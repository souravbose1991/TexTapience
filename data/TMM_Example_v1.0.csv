1,I was at work and I asked my supervisor what to do about a particular problem.  She said not to worry about it and we'd get to it later.  I then got chewed out by the boss because I left the problem unfixed.  I felt bad because I should have stuck up for yself.  I just let that girl throw me under the bus and I didn't say anything.  I wish I would've done things differently and stood up for myself more because I let her dictate my reputation and that wasn't fair.  My boss doesn't always care what my opinins are.  I don't like that he has so many other political considerations to think about.
2,"We have a great relationship. Whenever I need help with anything I can rely on his knowledge and expertise to help me out. He is available on call at any time. He shows me respect by letting me have freedom and autonomy. In other words he trusts me and dos not micromanage. My relationship with him is similar to others in that we trust him and he trusts us. His door is always open to all of us. I am a personable and sociable type of person so maybe I am a bit closer to him than others just because I am goo at small talk and chit chat. But thinking about it, I have been there over 6 years and never even had a cross word with him. It is a very professional relationship in that sense but there is also a personal aspect to it as well in that we all look up to im and he treats us with respect."
3,"I almost never speak with him. he does not know what i do and couldn't give me any coaching if he tried. but thankfully, he does not even try. My relationship with him is the same as with my previous manager - it is virtually nonexistent. That means that e barely ever interact other than at company holiday parties. I am basically on my own left to do what i think is best for my department and in my area using my skill set and experience. I guess I still have to come up with some more words to hit the minium lol. wow and now i got an error saying that this response must be at least 600 characters. you are joking - this is for one measly dollar? not enough money to justify this level of work."
4,"At work, my manager provides me with a great deal of coaching. Given that this was my first job, my manager really took me under his wing and showed me what I should be doing to succeed in my role at this company. He has always been kind and receptive to y needs as an employee. If I ever go above and beyond in a task, he always makes note of it and finds a way to somehow give back to me. This is not limited to me either. He has been treating all of his employees in this manner for years."
5,"Productive, respectful relationships between a boss and his or her employees is key to any company’s success. While the boss’ top priority is likely to have hardworking employees who fulfill his vision for the company, it’s a safe bet that he’d alo like to have more than superficial relationships with the people he works with every day. After all, he probably spends more time with his staff than he does with anyone else. There have been a number of times that I’ve shared ideas with employees, an they’ve come back and suggested—politely of course—that my idea may not be the best route. The reason I don’t get upset is because, along with the rejection of my idea, they present a suggestion for something else. Or, better still, they considerhow they can adapt my idea and make it work more effectively."
6,"  I am proved as much coaching and development that I feel that I need.  This is discussed at my Goals and objective meetings.  Basically whatever I feel I need will be provided for me.  My leader behaves in a way that I believe that she respects me.  Shealways listens to my ideas, and to my discussions that I have during meeting..  All of us in the dept. feel the same way toward my manger, she is the best.  This shows in all of our attitudes and our perfromance through out the company.  We are a very tigt group.  We have the attitude that what happens to one of us happens to all of us.  Working as a team is our main focus and is emphasized in everything that we do."
7,Currently the leader of my organization does not provide much coaching to myself as I our job duties are very much separate but benefit the same situations. He respects me by giving me things to accomplish that are difficult and sensitive showing that he rusts my work and believe in my abilities to accomplish tasks. My relationship with  my leader is different from co-workers because my job duties differ from the other ones. I have a specific portion of the business that I am in charge of and no one else s a support staff. Thus my leader and I work closer together on projects and tasks. We are very involved and my work directly affects his ability to do his work
8,I only see the Leader of my company every few months. She is good at telling us what we need to work on though at our quarterly meetings.  If we need remediation she communicates through phone or email to help us. She is friendly and unless you call off o do somthing really bad at work she will then be meaner. I had a friend who worked for the same place and my leader was not as kind to her.  But she had a lot of babysitting issues or very bad clients.  The leader wasn't able to work with her and she quit
9,It's not a great working relationship. We both work in a kitchen together as part owners and we tend to get very angry and frustrated with each other...as people tend to do when they're working in close confines and in stressful situations.
10,I have a positive relationshup with my work leader. He is always providing feedback on my teaching. He respects me because he always breaks down my areas of strength and my areas of weakness without making me feel worthless. I am constantly emailing him o speaking to him about what is happening in my classroom and what his opinion are. I believe i have a similar relationship that most of my coworkers have with him because our boss is very personable and friendly. He wantes the best for everoyne and his acions speak for themselves. he is a great boss. His performance is what drives us to be better leaders in our schools and teachers.
11,"My manager doesn't care about anyone but himself. He's selfish and doesn't pay any attention to lower level employees. He has no respect for anyone. He's discriminated against me and he's started rumors about me and other employees because I am gay and hesaw me as a threat because I spoke up to his higher ups about him harassing me. He was constantly watching my every move, telling me I couldn't do something even though other employees did them, my time stamps were being watched as well as when I left to o to lunch like who I left with and where I went. There is no coaching. I had to find out everything on my own. When he's ever presented with an issue in front of customers because lower level is confused or something gets jammed up, he has no idea what h's doing. So no. He's incapable of coaching."
12,"I respect there imput and look to them to be inspired. They have taught me most of what I know. I look to them when I have questions. He is alwyas there for when when I feel unsure of my purpose and where I should be going from here. I have never had a bos like him that care so much about my future. He looks in on what I am up too and helps me see a clearer path when I feel lost. He makes me feel valued as a team member, but just someone who was hired to do a job then forget about it."
13,"My supervisor was a bit strangely acting when I first started working under him. After about 2-3 months under him, we created a good working relationship that benefited both of us mutually at work.

He recognizes everyone's effort and appreciates whatevereffort we make to complete or showcase out talent at work. He behaves in a good manner even when met outside the work.

Regarding the relationship with other co-workers, he is fair among out group at least. He shares all work related materials and inputs ithin the team and expects all of us to put in our share of the work when working on a group project."
14,"With my job it is very independent, there is not a lot of interaction with the managers. Their are nice training sessions that I can attend to learn more or get clarity. I can also email my managers for help and assistance or concerns. I believe that the esponse to my concerns shows that my manager respects me. Most of those I work with have the same experience with the managers that I have. We are independent contractors so a lot of happenings are just between, me, myself, and I. However, there is a leadrship ladder, and high ups that i can consult when I need to. 

There is not a lot of interaction because this is a contract work, and it is a work from home position. so therefore access to people in general is limited. Hoiwever I do not feel alone in th lease. I feel the company has done a wonderful job in making sure I feel supported and like they are there when we need them. There are perks and drawbacks to working remotely."
15,"I think I have a great relationship with my leader; she is open with me and the coworkers on my team about company issues and goals.  I would say that my relationship is comparable to others on the team; we get along great, and she is always available to iscuss any issues I am having with my workload.  She provides coaching when we ask for it, but she is always will to send us off for training that will help us do our jobs better.  She does have the exact technical skill set needed to do a lot of our work so we must seek outside help at times.  She always stands behind our work and treats us with respect."
16,"The relationship that I have with my leader is a great one. We understand each other's goals and dreams and no that working in unison will help us both achieve what the other wants to do. When I am stuck in a rut, this person knows how to get me out of itand it works the other way. My leader also gives me the freedom to do what I need to do within the confines of my employ and that shows the kind of respect he has for me by letting me on the longer leash. This mutual respect helps strengthen what we did ad makes us a better team. This also fosters a work environment that people admire and look to when developing their team and the needs of their team."
17,"She and I have a very strong two way relationship.  She trusts me to run her restaurant, and I do my best to put my skills and training to use.  We bounce ideas off of one another and make the best of the situation.  We have each others backs and support ne another no matter what.  If I have a problem, I can go to her with it.  If she has something she needs to get off of her chest, she can talk to me and work it out.  We both know what we need to do to make this place run well.  We just really work well ogether and it has taken years to cultivate this relationship.  I feel like I am a family member at this place of work."
18,"My leader is a true representative with great leadership qualities. 
1) He helps in every way possible, if we have doubts regarding project or anything. He has vast knowledge in the area and thus help us with the same.
2) He is always polite and professioal while communicating with fellow members of the organization. He does not insult or make fun of any co-worker in front of an audience.
3) I think it is more or less same as my co-workers. My manager doesn't really discriminate between people of differen backgrounds or different departments. He has a good behavior towards each and every individual as a person."
19,"He give positive advice ,he behave show me very much respect,I have good relationship with my manager because if i done some error he care me and solve that error and problem also teach me how to do solve this also my leader gives advice how to do furtherand how to handle those errors with very calm ,also my leader shares the experience with me for positive attitude also share personal experience with me so that we have good relationship like friend ,i am very luck to have the great leader ,also have verymuch proud to this great leader

Some advice from my leader
A team leader should be a role model to his team members. He should treat each and every individual as one and avoid partiality at work Do not give anyone a special treatment just because he drop your son to school every day or says a yes to whatever you say. Appreciate if someone has done exceptionally well but do make sure to correct him if he is wrong somewhere. The team leader should not be rude or harsh to anyone. There is a correct way for verything and one should not insult any team member. It is strictly unethical. Sit with him and make him realize his mistakes. He would definitely look up to you in future.

The superior must not act pricy and should always be accessible to his employees.The individuals must have the liberty to walk up to their immediate bosses in case of a doubt and clear things. The hierarchy should not be too complicated as it leads to confusions and disputes among employees.

The manager must ensure that all importantcommunication takes place on an open forum for everyone to get a common picture. Problems arise when communication is done on a one to one basis. Call everyone together so that all the members are clear as to what is expected out of them and what their coleagues are up to. Communication should be transparent for an effective employee relation. Any employee should not feel neglected or left out. If the team leader wants to pass on any information to his team m"
20,"My leader is a good and helpful person. He always have time for me to make me understand things. He gives me a theoretical ex poser of what I am going to do and let me do the practical work for myself, so that I can learn and understand the problems and ticks behind a field work. He always pays attention when I tell him my ideas. Even when my ideas are bogus, he don't insult me. He tries to modify or reassess my ideas and polish it to be a good one, He behaves with all the employee in a friendly and helpfl manners and takes care of everyone. He made such an environment in the workplace that our intellectual can flourish without a hitch."
21,My Rm is not at all interested in the performance of an individual. He only prefer those who are political and threat for my rm in a job prospects . Because if he care those people then his job will be secure otherwise those political person will form a goup and go against the rm and throw the rm out of the company by creating fake allegations. He will not at all listen to anyone who behave good with him. He should be threatened in the one on one and should be scared for his job. Then only he take care ofhis team member. I He will not at all listen to anyone who behave good with him. He should be threatened in the one on one and should be scared for his job. Then only he take care of his team memberhate such type of team leader who are such scared of the ssociates. He should be brave enough to handle tough situations.
22,"my manager is smart and well educated, like me he also started at the bottom and now at the top,  he likes to see himself as a role model at work and he really encourages people to come up with different solutions and really encourages out of the box thining.  He will be watching but will let you have your way.  He has no tolerance to unsafe workers, safety in the work place comes first and rules are there to be followed,  He also ensures that none of us are over worked or  given extra responsibility wher there is some one else free and available to do that job.  Plus he constantly monitors each of his staff and tell them whats wrong or what is right"
23,"My leader,a respectable lady with years of experience,have personal relationship with everyone of the staff.In the 50 plus staffs,she keeps a special relation with me, I am also considers her as my true boss; for  the respect and considerations she gives e. She is always  by my side in case of new training program and put my first in all her priorities( of whom she considers as loyal subordinates).Even though she is 5 years older to me,she always treat me as her elder brother and behaves like with such  rspect.And I ,on my part,considers her  not as my supervisor,but my elder sister.She is friendly with all by co workers,but always put me first in anything connected with work."
24,My working relationship with my leader is really good. He helps me in everything. He supports me to a great extent. I am someone really special to him. He gave me a really good coaching and development to enhance my career and my organisation. He tries toset my personal goals along with sets and sides of the goals and purposes of goals of the organisation. My manager always respects me to a great extend. As compared to my co- workers relationship it is really good and great. The relationship is valued andto a great extend it is good. I enjoy this relationship and I want to be in this kind of relation with my leader.
25,"1. I do not get any coaching and development by my leader. I have never told what to do and the project were done by the worker but the name goes to the manager.
2. He shows the respect externally and in front but considering his behavior with others, I d not think its from heart. I think its for self accomplishment. It is just going professional and nothing more friendly type. I am not allowed to think on my perspectives. I should do only what he had told to do. I do not have independence to work on my on ideas. He does not provide resources even though he gets it from our organization. 
3. My relationship with my leader is good in behavior and some support for fresh innovative ideas. But neither me nor others do not trust our leader in revealing our ides."
26,"When I first started at my company, my leader gave me a fair amount of coaching, but after a few months, he stopped doing that and I was left to figure out things on my own.  He doesn't show me much respect, one example is I haven't had a desk or a cubicl or drawer or closet in one place in all my time at the company. Almost every day he sticks meet at a different work location, some of which are crowded and noisy and dark.  I cannot help but perceive that many of my coworkers have a much better relationsip with my boss than I do. And I'm sorry to say that I believe the reason why is that both my boss and most of my coworkers are Hispanic, and I am not."
27,"My manager give me totally freedom to do business in my own way he only tell me target , and whenever I achieve my target my manager give nature smile and salute me. My manager is good man he maintain good relation with all works. He is believe in work bu not in pressure , he believes pressure free environment creat positive effect in work place also in workers behaviour . whenever position is not positive my manager control his mind and always try to be positiv and that thing give us straight to work , w have good relation we are work like family ,This thing creat tension free work environment and creat really positive effect in work."
28,"I was just a newbie when I joined this company and my manager offered the essential time to learn the basics of the field. He never discouraged me for my mistakes. Infact, he played the role of the trainer at times. 
For three months, I was just learning he basics. He never pushed me to make things in a rush. The patient and interest has showered in that period of time was invaluable. 
All the credit goes to my leader as I'm being the top most personality in my field now. He never committed himself to comare my achievements with others.

All the credit goes to my leader as I'm being the top most personality in my field now He never committed himself to compare my achievements with others."
29,my boss goes the extra mile to make sure that we have basic knowledge and up to date training on the most current devices and products. I think he does very well in promoting great attitudes and to keep a strong motivated sense of happiness in and maongstour colleauges. I am happy with his professional approach to the way we a;ll inteeract with one another as well. he goes above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that everything is done and that everyone accomplishises their goals in a times fasion nd that the product quota is met. i have a great deep sense of respect for him as he does this and has a great smile on his face as well
30,"My leader offers very little coaching and development.  This is because she does not know herself.  I know more about the job than she does.  She occasionally shows that she respects me by greetings, listening and using my suggestions.  However, sometimesshe doesn't what she wants anyway which never has a good outcome.  I have a better relationship with my leader than my co-workers since I am her assistant.  I feel she does not respect my co-workers and acts in passive aggressive ways to most of them.  A ouple of them intimidate her and she does not correct them, but goes out of her way to correct those she can intimidate."
31,"We have a great manager.  She is always showing us how to do our work more efficiently, with less stress on us.  She behaves in a very professional manner, but is friendly with all of us too.  I really do believe that she treats us workers all the same.  f we have problems, she helps us.  If we need any additional products to do our work, she really tries to get it for us as soon as she can.  She provides meetings a lot to talk to us about  her concerns or if she has complaints about any of us.  She holdsmeetings for all of us and also private meetings for any one of us if she needs to talk to us in private."
32,"1. When I joined the organization, he provided all the required care and assistance. Even now, he asks me for any required guidance and approves any required training for me. 

2. My leader always valued by opinion in all the activities related to the orgnization. Whenever there is any disagreement, he sits with me and try to understand my point of view about the problem.

3. My leader does not show any discrimination between the people working under him. He treats me and others in this team equally. He mintain a good relationship even with people who are not considered to be so good performers in the organization."
33,"My leader, which is also my manager, is very considerate. He always asks if I can do the job correctly. He also offers his skills if there's something I don't understand. My leader respects each and everyone in a way that he is not bossy- type of a leader He really loves working with us and it makes me happy that my leader gives time for us when we need him. I have no issues related to my leader because he's so generous and humble to us. My leader treats us fairly. And that's how I describe the working reationship of my leader. My leader and I are working almost 2 years and we never had some big issues with each other."
34,"There was limited coaching and development, more of a throw you in and you either sick or swim mentality. With very limited training it is hard to really know what is expected of you, what the overall goal of the company is and how to proceed in finding yu fit within the organization. All these item can be tricky when entering a new work environment and social arena. My leaders behavior shows they respect me every once and a while with kind written words. The leader is not one to express emotions or appreiation well, it is a great effort on mynleaders part so I have learned to extend that curtesy to staff. Ocassionally I will,get verbal compliments of appreciation and I receive them more so than other employees and outside staff. My relationship with my lader compared to others in the work place is far better, I have earned the leaders respect and go out of my way to show the leader I put in that extra effort before I am asked. This allows me to have that extra one on one time with the leader as well as drectly point out my completed tasks and extra efforts,  to so they can be recognized and compensated but so these efforts can me remembered later. Overall, my relationship is good with my leader currently. However, I have only been employed there in this apacity a limited amount of time. It is my understanding that overtime the relationship with the leader always comes to an impasse sort of a falling out. It is my great effort to not have that happen and keep the interest so to speak with my leader. It ismy thinking that doing the extras can only improve my relationship with my leader and prolong the good relationship."
35,"My leader provides a good deal of coaching and development but I think this is mostly due to that being part of his job description and it is a state mandated role he undertakes. I do not believe he provides this coaching and development out of any personl connection with myself. He has always been very respectful in our interactions with each other and always shows deference to my expertise in areas that he has a limited knowledge of. I believe my relationship with my leader is the same, no more, no less than that of my fellow co-workers. There are some who connect with him on a different level due to personal hobbies but not much more than that."
36,"My leader is also my guide and mentor. He always guides me and helps me when I struggle with any work. He is very gentle and kind, and praises my efforts and takes them to the management. He advises me on where to obtain career coaching that would enhancemy promotion offers and get me more payment from the management.  He likes my work and dedication and therefore he encourages me and mentions about my good work to my co-workers. He treats me like a child and always compliments me whenever any project preentation gets extra payment for my good work. He respects me and shows it whenever occasion arises, in presentations, when I have festivities in my family. He always attends all my family occasions unlike the other employees to whose functions, he goes ony when possible."
37,"He is generally a friendly guy. But as I am very new to this firm, he try to not to be silly with me. But I can see my co-workers who joined before me is talking very friendly with the manager. But manager takes advantage of them too to accomplish some pesonal works. He rarely talks with me. He tries to keep a distance from me. But at the same time he didn't gave me any work loads. He sometimes wishes me in the morning. He always minds me when he is passing past me. He is an easy guy. He is sometimes chilish with my senior co-workers and he talks about his personal affairs with them. But is very strict on some important issues at work."
38,"First of all, It is my pleasure to share my experience. My Team leader is really most down to earth person, who cares and helps everyone belongs to him. But he has special attention towards me because I am proactive and a jovial person. I try to complete he works allowed for me and at the mean time I try to start helping my colleague. I hope so this attitude of mine makes me stand out from the crew as a unique. He assists me a lot and gives lots and lots of ideas to think more innovatively like him. So I m really blessed to work under his supervision. In my point of view, I don't want to separate him by saying that he is my head. Instead of that, all our team members used to call him as a brother, because he gives freedom with some extend like a brother a the same time we maintained that greatness by completing our projects and tasks before the deadline comes."
39,"as our leader is always friendly and he coaches me at all time when i needed with out asking he helps me without hesitation and improved my development a lot, if i did a mistake he wont show in in front of others he will call me and show my error and teac me how to over come this problems without doing any mistakes later, and he is not behaving like a leader he is always friendly and leader at the time when i needed, his guidance makes me more comfortable and energetic which makes to prove myself in all tings and i like him so much, because of his leadership and his appearance was so polite and not show his as a leader but as a friend for all and he supports all co workers with out any hesitation"
40,"My leader is helpful in many ways to me. He always listens to my problems and difficulties professional as well as personal. Whenever there is some mistake from my side, he always stands by me. In front of any other employees of our company; my manager dos not scold or shout at me. That is why i can say that he respects me and gives me full cover and freedom. My relationship with my manager is far better than of any other employee's with my manager. This  I can say on the basis of many examples like we dicuss our personal problems with each other or about sports, movies etc also. Some times we go out for dinner or lunch, even then also he always keeps me in front of everybody.  My manager helps me emotionally and if required financially also. Like for exaple, i needed some money for hernia operation of my little brother. In this case, my manager also contributed in paying some part of the medical bill. He also helps in achieving me my goals and objectives at my work place. My supervisor is very caring andsincere. He takes the responsibility on his shoulders always and never runs away. He always provides guidance to me regarding solving problems at my work place. Like for example, once i found myself in soup when one our clients defaults in a payment. At tat time my supervisor helped me to tackle with that client to extract payment from the client.   My manager helps me emotionally and if required financially also.

41,"I really love to work under my current supervisor who is the vice principal of our school and the head of sections class IX to XII.  She is very sincere and honest and motherly figure for me.  She guides me always and has always a lot positive energy whic transfers to the employees.  She gives responsibility now and then and she appreciate my abilities whenever she gets an opportunity.  Whenever I get such type responsibility I believe that she cares for me and respect me in my work.  I feel most of the eployees who work under will have the same kind of relationship what I have with my madam or sometimes even more than me.  All in all, I love to work under her."
42,"My manager is generally uninterested in helping or supporting people in general. While he is good at his job he is very uninterested in moving anything forward or showing support to his better staff. He will basically ignore complaints and not be willing o help people when they need it. He basically treats everybody equally. Although he does have a few newer staff members who he shows more concern towards. It is very frustrating being in this situation, but he has made it clear that he is not going to be hanging. It is fairly easy to ignore him for the most part but it still doe grate on me and make me wish that things were different."
43,"1) My leader provided me enough time to learn new things for the project, he encouraged me to learn new technology. At the very first time he gave me big module and asked me to do it as a challenge. sometimes he sits with me to make everything clear. 
2) e checks with my opinion, whenever he talks to client about requirement and go with my suggestion to them. He talked about me to other managers and asked me to help their projects.
3) Its a neat leader-member relationship, comparing to others most of the ime its same, sometimes there will be extra care about my safety. He is like a big brother to me."
44,"I have a wonderful relationship with my manager. She gives me a daily briefing on what is happening at the store, what is on sale, what needs to be taken care of that day. Then, I am allowed to take it from there. I check in with her via text message a fe times a shift on our sales status and other pertinent happenings and at the end of the day I report the total sales to her. She is always appreciative and thanks me. She thanks me, also, for coming in when I am not scheduled, if I am needed. My fellow coworkers also express a lot of confidence and having a good relationship with her. A very good manager."
45,My organization is very concern about my well being. Especially  my manager is very helpful and dedicated. He is very concern about the well being of his team mates. He give lot of enthusiasm and encouragement for the team members. He also give us lot of ips to do the projects quick and with error free. He also fight with the management to get correct reward for the best worker. He is some what special for me and he has lot of personal touch with me. He share all things apart  from work. Personally he car for the team members and do lot of favour for them. He is one who love the team members and he work for the well being of the team members
46,"The relationship with the company's leader is slim. We do not see them much and we do not communicate much.   We only deal with our direct supervisor, who I adore. Our leader only talks to us when there is a compliant or other negative issues.  This perso is the same way with everybody else.   She is the main person in the department however, I report to my supervisor so I try not to communicate with this department leader as it turns into a headache because she is not competent in my sections work tasks. The supervisor in this department is a hard worker and very approachable, even people in my department that do not report to my supervisor, always come to her for advice to avoid meeting with the department leader."
47,"My manager is ready to give basic coachings and training related to work. He expect me to catch up once the basic training is over. He doesnt behave like he respects me, but act like a boss and is ready to listen to my concerns. For some of the instances e may not revert on the concerns and we have to live with it. When compared to my co workers relationship with the manager, my relation is a bit better. I am getting a neutral stand from my manager where as my coworkers may be getting some negative feelins as well. When he gives his performance rating also he may behave like a neutral person."
48,"I would describe my relationship with my leader as one of give and take. That is, my effort is rewarded and I am made aware of the appreciation of it. Sometimes I have to take on more work than I would like to but my leader shows me that he appreciates whn I go the extra mile. I would say that there is an understanding between us, whereas many co-workers are more interested at advancing their own interests rather than working together to perform better as a whole. My leader is definitely someone you can tust and will do his best to make sure he notices good work. Some co-workers will try to jump ahead of you for a promotion but my leader honors loyalty over flattery."
49,"When I joined the company, I dont have any corporate experience. My Manager showed me how to focus on my job, how to ignore the back biters, and how to improve my personality. He trusted me for my straight forwardness and honesty. When he found I have mor talents than my current field, he nurtured me to proceed further. When some people are jealous of me, he gave me more work so that I can prove to myself and to them. He made others realize, I work properly and honestly. He keeps on compliments me even afer 6 years of service in same job.

My boss is honest, brilliant and very much innovative. My organization had taught me a lot to improve myself and the management team is very supportive and always encourages new ideas. My company is one of the best platorms to prove ourselves. 

I have observed the lot of strong points in my boss but the most things which I have observed or I have learnt from him is that he is innovative, energetic, is punctuality, well merged with the time management skills and fully ddication to the work and always try to learn from mistake or failure and guide to all employees on time by time and arranging training to the employees when ever needed, giving the chances to the employees for their better improvement in their respective rea, but as as we know that every person have some drawback also, nobody is always perfect. 

My boss has good ideas, they work very well. The only issue really is he always has everyone working on what they are weak at. That is good for us but not good fr overall productivity. A good team would really have people doing what they are good at. So each team member covers of certain areas for the team and you have a highly effective team, with everyone doing excellent work in areas of proficiency.

He is appoachable, spontaneous, energetic, punctual, having ability to prioritize things well, very supportive for his team members, a good motivator, strong in networking and an ambitious person. I have learnt a lot"
50,"I have a good relationship with my supervisor, he is pretty hands off about most things and allows me free reign to do my own work. He takes the attitude as long as I'm doing well, then I should be left alone to do what I'm doing. He understands that our rganization can be pretty stupid at times and therefore does try and force stupid policy down my throat. He does need to be pushed sometimes on a few things in order to have top efficiency but that is made up by actually being able to get most things donewithout alot of resistance. I think the most important quality of our relationship is that we have trust between us, and that there is no concern of either of us betraying the other or trying to screw the other in the typical office politics."
51,"I think my leader make a great effort for me and the organization, he talks very much with me and my coworkers, he calls for meetings in the work week at the biggining of the week and in the final and in that form we can see the results of our effort and ard work , i think the relationship with my leader and my coworkers is very special and we try to take the best way to do the things in our community i think we need to share more in the week ends and talk about our family and in that form we can know abor our personal problems and solve betwenn friends  we need to realize manny mettings in the week and finally in the month we have a great meeting with all our bosses and in that form they can know about the form to change methods to solve problems in the ales department we can see betwenn coworkers about the form we can do a team work, i expect my coworkers and i try all the suggestions dictated from our bosses and in that form we can improve our skills and be the best team of the company we can realize al the things in our company allways making before a presentation of our future work and waiting for the aprovation or negation of our principal leaders must be a complete team work i think thats the form to give a company the best form to make the things nd i try all the sistem with my family i am sure theat the best recomentation for me and my family an my coworkers we can see all the thigs outside in thamost easily form but inside the is the part with most difficults things we can share and we can asimiite buts the principal thing is the make the difference betwenn departments and we can do many things in our company to make a better world i hope i will work in my company for manny years and mke the best impression and in thefuture do the work of my boo because that tipe of work demands vry much and the time of that tipe of work is very exhaustings and demanding we can give much money but we be distanciated of our family and thats not price i expect the rea"
52,"My manager will lead me with his intellect and clearly states the project requirements and my role & Objectives to pursue best quality work and good ways to attain higher positions in my field of work. He is my mentor in guiding me the right way, he firstdoes his work in perfect absolution and perceive it to me as guidelines to achieve particular step, he respects my attitude and provide me enough personal space to learn from it, if i am stepping out he warns and direct to right path. He was a true leaderbecause he will not leave anyone behind and has good commitment and a good word for everyone particularly me."
53,"A particular danger in these situations is that people or organizations that are being managed by such an individual or group think they're being led; but they're not. There may actually be no leadership at all, with no one setting a vision and no one beig inspired. This can cause serious problems in the long term.

In the transformational leadership model, leaders set direction and help themselves and others to do the right thing to move forward. To do this they create an inspiring vision, and then motvate and inspire others to reach that vision. They also manage delivery of the vision, either directly or indirectly, and build and coach their teams to make them ever stronger."
54,"My leader provides very little feedback or correspondence. He is not supportive of me or our unit members when it comes to dealing with client service issues. He will break or bend rules to suit the whim of the client, which is not very supportive. It maks me feel disrespected. He doesn't use any opportunity to show how you can improve. He doesn't model or demonstrate good behavior himself. He has one clear favorite person who is allowed to break any rules she pleases, and to simply not do her assigned taks. Others have to do her work, as well as their own, which created a negative environment."
55,"After joining job position in my company, I was very pleased after meeting with colleagues . I wished that may be my manager will also be of good nature.
After 1 week of working their ,they provide very little assistance . When ever there will some proble occur with me in my project I get very least amount of guidance from them.
They show too much of attitude and superiority, even if i completed my job with very good manner.This happens not only with me but with every co-workers, but some of the employeeswithin my ranks are favorite of the leaders.
Relationship between us is not so not too bad, only formal business relationship exist between us."
56,we have a strong relationship that is based on a mutual respect and admiration for the work that we do togethers. together we have a great coaching relationshp in which we can give and get encouragement on a non confrontational manner. the relationship wih my leader compares almost similiar to other co workers relationship as our managment staff is open honest and in out of sincere care for getting the job done. It is more than vital that this relationship remain in place in order to continue our approprite work life relationship and interpersonal family like environment. I am happy at this place of work.
57,He sets down the rules and he tells me what to do. We don't have the kind of communication that I wish we had. He is sometimes mean to me and yells. But he can also be nice as well. He has a lot of pressure on him and call them all he time. We all agree tat he is a bit of tyrant and we make fun of him sometimes. He sometimes recpects us by giving us gift cards and cookies. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhggggggggggggggggggfgfgfggfgfgfgfgffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
58,My relationship with my leader at work is very unique. He provides me with ample development resources and advice although he has somewhat unprofessional and very childish and joking behaviors he is very smart . It is hard to determine when he is being seious or just plain annoying but i can always count on him to stand up for me and my team when we need it. My leader also plays favorites among my team-mates and it is very blatant that I am one of those favorites. Many of my co workers can not get along wth our leader because only a few people really understand him and know how to take his unique sense of humor.
59,"My manager stands up for me.  When I tell her my thoughts on an issue, she goes to bat for me.  She doesn't back down.  That shows that she respects me and my thoughts and ideas.  She is easy to talk to.  She has a good relationship with everyone on my tem.  She is well liked.  We have a monthly meeting where we discuss my goals and how they are progressing.  We also discuss the projects I am working on and any concerns I may have, or any concerns she may have.  I enjoy working with her and interacting wih her on a daily basis, as do other people in our department.  She shows respect to everyone when they talk in meetings.  She lets up voice our opinions and ideas without making us feel bad."
60,My working relationship with my leader is co-operational and corporate. We work in exchange for profits and welfare of the team. My leader talks about the way he has taken and an approach he has followed for any consented trade agreement. He also discusse how he did it how results can be taken care of efficiently. My leader welcomes my entry and recognizes my presence in the place.He shows concern and respect to his best that brings in benefits. My relationship with the leader compared to co-workers with he same individual is not different. It stands almost inside a definite compartment where decisions are based upon in everyday work.
61,"My leader allows me a great deal of autonomy in the creative aspects of my job while trusting me to ensure that I will work in partnership as needed with others where there are specific procedures and technical issues which need to be worked out. They do ot provide me with coaching or specific training opportunities at present, but do introduce me to experts in fields where I have expressed a need and desire to learn and grow in order to get better work done. They show respect by recognising measurable acievements and praising where appropriate, and when there are problems they show understanding and a very helpful attitude. We have a very high level of trust which allows for extensive distance working and little direct supervision day to day."
62,"I have got a very kind and cooperative project leader with whom I feel very comfortable. She gave me good training in the beginning of my job in this organization and till now understands my needs and likes to help me in every problem that I faces in the ob. She also understands that I have some health and family problems and allocates me work according to that.

Comparing to other coworkers, I think she likes me very much and we in fact have become friends outside the office also. I should thank God thatI have a good friend as my leader and supervisor. I first thought that she would be very strict, but she was very friendly to everyone and each one of us in the group likes her very much.

She strives to take us in the good path and wants each one of us t be a group leader. She also has been strict in many ways like no one has to come late, unnecessary leaves should be avoided etc etc. She sets targets for us every month and makes us achieve the goals. She will never show any partiality between us inside he office. Even if she gets scoldings from higher officer, she remains upset, but she never show it to any one of us."
63,"My leader coaches me to make me a better individual and help me develop my skills future more. This will in the future benefit me and the organisation and to some extent the mankind. In general, he is a good individual with immense knowledge and he believs in sharing his knowledge and experiences. He generally shows respect by giving us small token of appreciation, sometimes planning a get together and taking the team out for lunch. My leader, I can say is a bit partial to certain individual and is also vry critical. Sometimes he can be good to a person and the other day he can be rude to that same person. With very few people he maintains a constant equation."
64,"My supervisor doesn't really know how to do my job however she has a very good overview of the company as a whole.  She knows which clients we need to spend extra time with and which ones need special treatment.  She respects me by leaving the details of ompleting my assignment up to me.  Very rarely has she ever requested that I change a completed project.  She trusts me to get the job done.  My relationship with my supervisor is very much the same as other's relationship with the supervisor.  She doesn' play favorites or act differently toward one person or another.  She seems to be fair to everyone and have the same rules for the entire department.  If I am required to work a weekend for an assignment, others will take their turns as weekend jobs come p.  My supervisor puts in the time but has her own agenda of work to be done and doesn't micromanage the department."
65,as a leader he provides me lot of advises and supports and he see me as a hard worker and i give my full effort to him and he gives moral support and respect me when i tell some advises and he do not show me anger and compare to other co worker he shows m more support and helps me a lot which gives me moral support and helps to achieve more in life and also to succeed project and relationship with others makes me more helpful and encourages others too and makes all relationship well together and gives mor efficient and energetic and was very happy and successful and it makes to get more projects in future
66,"My leader will not give much training,he will arrange training all the time to know new technology.He always treat us well in office.My relationship with my leader is mutual,comparing to other co-workers,he will always treat me good and tell about his vie and passion to start his business and family issues and struggle alot.He is always strict with other co-workers and maintenance staffs,but somehow he will treat me as his asset of this company and insisting to do alot in stock market and earn some good mney apart from my job.My leader is good and clean in his personal life,so he always teaching me some tactics to solve the problems in family."
67,"My leader is a good man to teach everything about my job from starting time. My leader is male. He is respect well with me at work and personal also, because I am a best for him in work. Our relationship is good at work and personal also. So I am very hapy to work in my organization by my leader. My leader behave same at all workers like me. Then my organization is very important to me in my life. Because my organization give full freedom to me at work. Then my co-workers also fine to behave in my work. S my leader is best for us. My leader behave same at all workers like me. Then my organization is very important to me in my life. Because my organization give full freedom to me at work. Then my co-workers also fine to behave in my work."
68,"My leader provides plenty of help and mentorship when interacting the her, she is one of my heroes and has overcame a lot of adversity in the past herself. She knows how it feels to start from scratch and make it to the top so she helps many of us gain moentum with the utmost respect on most issues that turn up. She tends to be somewhat scatterbrained but rarely shows it with too much intensity, she is human like everyone else and is not completely flawless in anything either. There are never any times whre I feel she is favoring any of the employees over another one at all, she treats everyone as equals. I really do look up to her and her entire journey to succeed and make our business do as well. She is very much in need of an award in my opinion. Anyon would be proud to work where we do and for her."
69,"My leader has monthly one on one meetings with me to discuss goals and development opportunities. She treats me with respect by listening to my ideas and suggestions. She is always open to hearing new ideas that me and my coworker might have about processimprovements. She also provides a lot of good advice about career development, and other projects I can work on to have some more visability. There are three of us in our group: our boss, myself, and one other coworker. My coworker has the same good relatonship with our boss as I do. Our boss seems to have a good relationship with everyone in our office."
70,"Leaders in my organization are picked from college kids and groomed into leadership.  The problem is that the leader often times knows very little about what we actually do.  Therefore we do not get any direct coaching from the leader.  I don't really fee respected by my leader.  The co-workers have the same opinion that I hold, simply that there is a rift between leaders and the workers.  They have no idea what we do in any given day, only judging us by stats that are spit out of a spreadsheet.  They usethese stats to judge us.  While that is a good beginning, it certainly does not give a true picture of an individual and their contributions."
71,"My employer values the suggestions and hard work of those who give themselves for the organisation. As for me I see him as one who values tradition and ethics in work place and in personal life. He gives due regard to each ones aspirations for growth in bth personal and professional life. I have been with this group for the past 7 years and though at times I had suffered due to work pressures from colleagues , I felt that my employer was with me and understands the situation which kept us going together. e always gave me the first chance when it comes to career development training programmes and I reciprocated that with using the knowledge for the growth of the organisation."
72,"My leader is very young and really does not have a grasp on this whole manager thing.  My leader provides very little coaching and supervision.  I know my job duties and just do them.  My leader does respect me, but not necessarily how a supervisor should  She is intimidated by me and wants me to like her.  Therefore, when I ask to leave early or do whatever I want, she lets me.  She behaves very similarly with the other co-workers.  Some people are here favorites and get by with more and others need moredirection and she tries to do that.  
]
I used the minimum of 100 words and now it says it has to be at least 600 characters.  What?"
73,We really don't have a relationship and there is really not a lot of coaching. The job I work for is very unethical to some degree they rarely understand what I'm going through and never try to fix it. I only get minor coaching from my team lead. My managr and I rarely have anything to say to one another which is odd. He does his own thing and I just do my job. My relationship with mlthe vice president is better than with my manager. She shows respect by telling the good and bad that I'm doing at my job ad how I can improve. She stated at one point that she really wants to see me succeed at the company and that was very touching for me whichade me want to do better here. I didn't really have hope but now i kind of do.
74,"My direct manager and I have a very active and dynamic relationship. I am on a small team of four people, led by my manager. Because of the small size of the team, my manager is able to provide a great deal of hands-on training and guidance. She checks inwith me regularly to ask if I have concerns or comments. My manager shows respect to me by regularly asking for input and opinions and then acting on them. She treats my teammates similar to the manner in which she treats me. We have a very honest workingrelationship and I believe that fosters mutual respect and cooperation. Since we work in conjunction with a much larger team (something like fifty individuals), it's important we five act in a consistent manner and cooperate regularly."
75,My supervisor or leader has been an incredible person to look up to. If I have any issues he always makes sure that he sees that they are dealt with. He has coached me to help me make steps in the right direction for promotions. He does respect me and alwys values whatever input I have. I believe that he is there for all of his immediate subordinates in the same way. He makes sure that he asks about 2 times a month if everything has been going alright and if there is anything that I would like to address ith him. He is really an outstanding leader. I have suggested him as employee of the month before and even told his boss that he deserves a raise or a bonus for how effective he is and how efficient he is.
76,"My leader gives me the big picture concepts but allows and gives me enough freedom to implement things as I see fit. He respects my ability and knows that I know what I am doing and for that fact, leaves me alone for the most part. He knows if he comes tome with a problem I will try and be proactive in responding to the situation and do the best I can. Other people do not have the same level of support and are looked at more carfully and critically than I am. I enjoy having the freedom that I do. I have icidents in which I have been able to deal with the situation directly without even involving him because of the level of trust that he has given me."
77,"My manager is an excellent coach and mentor to me. She guides us and allows us to work independently. She allows us to make decisions at a high level without needing her input, but provides it if asked. We meet bi-weekly to discuss projects and assignment and their progress. She does not micromanage us but allows us to work at our own pace as long as we continue to meet our deadlines. My entire team respects my manager. We are a tight knit group that socializes together and works as a highly effective tea. My manager tells us that we are a high achieving team and encourages us to do better every day."
78,"My leader always give the best knowledge transfer, I really happy about it. In the respect perspective as well I am very happy with it. He never expects I should stand in front of him and always accepts our ideas and suggestions as well. He always use ver respectful language and compose the mail well in the similar way. So he always gives respects to his co workers and colleague's.
When compared with my relationship with my co workers, my leader is somewhat always maintains some distance. Even I like the ame, else it will make some discomfort.
So that distance is good which is my opinion and I feel comfortable in it."
79,He does not do too much to help us he just sits in his office and we have to go to him with some questions. He then solves the problem usually and thats it. he tries to be manipulative but he is not very good at it. We all know he does not respect us muchand only hires women because he likes looking at them. He even admitted the last girl he hired  was just hired because she was a model. So that goes to show how much he respects us. But hey a paycheck is life basically.    the survey says 100 words but no it wants 600 characters? x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x xx random worrds with letters to make characters yayayyayayayayayayayayayayayayayayaayyayaya.
80,"My manager and I have a good relationship. We spend time each quarter reviewing my work plan and going over my skill development as well as my goals for the fiscal year. He shows respect towards me by listening to my needs and my goals and providing suppot when needed. Compared to my co-workers, my manager and I are more on a peer to peer level since we are closer to age than many of my co-workers. We treat each other as adults which is a good thing. I see him employ different tactics with my co-workers bsed on their background and experience. He does a good job of tailoring his managerial skills based on the individual worker. I enjoy working with my current manager. He does a good job."
81,My relationship with the leader is pretty good. We really get along very well. The boss has helped me out because he knows that I always do an amazing job doing my work. My boss is very professional and shows me a lot of respect like each boss should. Therelationship that is compared to the other co-workers is the same. The leader will treat me the same as each and every individual the same. He won't treat anyone different because we are a team. We all work together as a whole and we  get things done. He espects us workers because we all get along with each other. He knows that we are very unique in every way. He notices we all work differently and as long he knows that we will get the job done the right way.
82,"My leader give me a lot of coaching.  I have free reign over most of my schedule but if I run into a question or have a special project we will have meetings to discuss them.  She will often share changes in the company policy or procedures with me and wediscuss the marketing of the department together.  I think that my coworkers have a similar relationship with my leader to the extent that they seek it out.  The people who complain that they're not ""in the loop"" are the people who never ask direct questins of our manager.  For some reason even though the instructions on this item tell me that I must use at least 100 words in my response, when I attempt to proceed with the task I get an error telling me I must have at least 600 characters.  I'm not sure i this is an error in the instruction on the task, or if this is an error in the program that allows the survey to proceed."
83,"My manager takes care of our group. He gives us extra days off and other incentives to meet goals, and he takes an active interest in our growth and development. He trains each of us, and is highly qualified in most IT-related fields. He acts as a buffer etween us and other departments, whose employees occassionally vent frustration at tech failures. The only problems I have with him are that he doesn't always follow through. He schedules time to work with us, but gets too busy and forgets. I've also waitd hours past the appointed time to meet with him, which can be really aggrevating and frustrating."
84,"My direct leader is actually a really nice guy and I would say he is fair. However, there is definitely a double standard where I work. I have a college degree like everyone else but to get my foot in the door I took and administrative position. I do morework than most people here and get the least recognition and the most criticism. I am constantly being asked to do things that really should be others responsibilities and I make the least amount of money and have the least benefits. My boss is pretty nic to me and he is understanding when things come up with my son. But, I have to flaunt the things I do to get him to notice and a lot of times he will ask me to do things that I have already done."
85,"Last month, I started working as a case manager with a new organization. My direct supervisor has been with the agency for three years, but she is new to the supervisor position. She has provided me with little guidance, but I believe that she does care aout my success with the agency. She assigns me to shadow case managers in her unit, so that I can observe some of the job responsibilities, but she has never sat with me one on one to talk about the position or introduce ourselves. This is sometimes uncomortable for me. For example - she often forgets when I will be in the office and only approaches me when she has a specific need at the time. I see that she has a good working relationship with fully trained case managers, so perhaps she doesn't know whatto do with trainees since this is also new for her."
86,"My leader provides a large amount of leadership. She has provided a lot of coaching and training on specific topics related to my professional development. She also demonstrates a lot of respect to me and other employees. When ever an employee goes above nd beyond the call of duty, my leader responds with some sort of display proportional to whatever action. For example, simply staying behind to make sure everything is done properly was acknowledged with a letter. As far as relationships go, my relationshp with my leader is similar to other coworkers mostly because of well-modeled expectations for the work place."
87,"My leader provides coaching and development when it is required.  However, he is aware of each of our abilities and customized the amount of input that he provides to each of us.  He is aware that I like to try doing stuff on my own before wanting help toaccomplish the task, so will wait until I ask for help.  On the other hand, he knows that my coworker won't ask for help, so he keeps an eye on what is happening and steps in when that person becomes frustrated. He shows his appreciation for a job well doe with little gifts like coffee, or buying us lunch.  He will also host a get together for the entire team and will often pick up the bill. On long days when the entire team needs to keep our minds on the task at hand, he will often buy lunch for the entie team."
88,My leader makes sure that all of our coworkers skills and knowledge are up to date. He makes sure that every Associate is trained the right way so the can do their job efficiently with their safety as their top priority. My leader behaves in a very moral nd fair way to show that they respect each Associate and all the hard work that they do. They thank each Associate every week for all the hard work that they do and tells them to have a good weekend. Sometimes our leader will buys us pizza or some reward o thank us for meeting standards and all the hard work and dedication that we have done. My relationship is a little different with him then with my coworkers because I just keep it professional and work related. I do not being my personal life or matterslike that into our relationship because I do not want to make things weird or have any problems because  of that.
89,My leader provides the required level of training. He is very patient and is ready to solve any work related problems. There is no need to hesitate when I have any doubt regarding work matters.My leader is very patient to listen to my problems. He is veryefficient in solving my doubts regarding work matters. He is very capable and I can rely on him. My leader provides the required level of training. He is very patient and is ready to solve any work related problems.

He is very capable and I can rely on him.
90,"My leader, Ted, is just fabulous.  I work for 6 attorneys, and I have worked for him the longest.  He always answers any questions about a case I have, whether they're about what's going on or procedural questions about filings and how the law works with espect to them to make sure I get stuff right and just to set something right that looks unusual to me so that I understand it.  He is always pleasant, says hello and comes in to chat with me, is up for chatting when I drop in, and includes me on emails wen appropriate.  He's offered to intercede with me with HR when they were giving me sort of strange assignments.  I think anyone reasonable has the same relationship with him, as he is very easy to get along with, provided you are an agreeable person.  Heis the most reasonable person I've met, but he doesn't put up with jerks!"
91,My relationship with my leader is pretty solid and is one of the better relationships I have at work.  He does not do a lot of coaching as my roll is pretty specific but I think he would if he could.  He does show respect for me and makes me feel like I a an important part of the company.  He is a bit disorganized at times so I will sometimes feel like I need to push him to get stuff from him but that is his relationship with everyone.  Overall I think he treats me as well or better than he treats any othr employees at the company.  
92,"I feel like he will make the effort to bring people along, and train them for higher positions, as long as that person is willing and able to learn. If you put in the effort, he respects that and will treat you accordingly. He is always treating his peopl to lunch and other things to show appreciation for long days of hard work. All the others in the office are the same way. In addition, time off for personal reasons are not usually an issue. You can ask, but he wants to make sure your jobs are done and tat your duties are finished. If you keep up with your work, you are rewarded. The others in the office interact with him in the same way.  If you do not meet the standards of what is expected, then you would not be hired on in this department, so everyonehas the same work ethic."
93,"My leader can be a difficult person but I have learned how to deal well with her and comply with what she expects. She is not a warm or welcoming person, but she has very high expectations that I want to meet. I don't know why I seek her approval to the lvel that I do, but I do really want her to like me and support me. We have had conflict in the past, which exhibited her immaturity (as a 60 year old woman), selfishness, and hands off approach. However, I do appreciate her professional wisdom and guidanc. I think our relationship is bettering as I learn better to deal with her.

(I used over a 100 words but the text box is saying I must use 600 characters?)"
94,My leader always supports and guide my life in the work i do. He is a kind of person with positive attitude and helping tendency and the way he uses his good attitude is a great thing. He share all his knowledge with each and every individual. he treats al his colleagues as equal to him without any sort of jealous and bad thought. He is really a great inspiration to all of us and especially me. He has a great respect towards me as I was a hard worker and finishes the job in a certain predefined time. So w were always close enough than any other co-workers in our work place.  I was happy to work with him.
95,"Our leader at work is a little bit hands off.  We work in a different city, so he doesn't know what's happening on the ground.  While this is the case, he really tries to understand what's happening here.  

He shows that he respects me by always listenng to my thoughts, and giving them consideration.  It is his job to listen to us about what work conditions are like here, and he does a really good job with that.  

I think that my coworkers have less of a relationship with him.  I have been with the rganization for over 10 years, and have known the leader for 5-6 years.  Because of this rapport, I feel like we better understand each other.  The others on my team have been with the organization for less than a year."
96,"Productive, respectful relationships between a boss and his or her employees is key to any company’s success. While the boss’ top priority is likely to have hardworking employees who fulfill his vision for the company, it’s a safe bet that he’d alo like to have more than superficial relationships with the people he works with every day. That is same my leader or boss really very nice to me. He really very helping in work. They manage all and treat very well. They also compare all employee same. thy manage all to help employee. They make every schedule in nice way.I would always rather have employees tell me when something at work or at home is affecting the rest of their lives than to wonder why their productivity has suddenly dipped or why they?e developed a bad attitude."
97,"When I first came on board, my manager went through all the steps of what would be my duties for my job.  She went above and beyond to give me tips on how things work at the organization.  She is always willing to listen and to help her employees when we eed it.  If I have issues that need to be addressed, she takes the time to go over what is wrong.  There have been times when I needed some time off for personal reasons, and she was more than willing to accommodate my needs.  She also does not allow her orkers to engage in drama.  My coworkers and I all have similar experiences with her, as she's consistent across the board with all of us."
98,"My working relationship with leader is cordial, clear, polite, but casual. There is a certain sense of comraderie ""in the trenches,"" so to speak, in dealing with the chaos all around and all the little fires that have to be put out. She does provide advic, and some short- to mid-range goals for me and is supportive of that, but I usually have to find my own formal training programs or development -- through conferences, webinars through a professional organization, or through online MOOCs such as edX or Cursera. She shows respect mainly by letting me take my own initiative to set forth certain things that I want to achieve -- like projects of my own making that help her, help our department, and help the entire organization at large -- without asking for e to do them. She doesn't mind me coming in to her office to talk, and is happy to just talk sometimes about all sorts of things. I believe the relationship I have with her is on par with others in immediate unit save for a few, with one person having a wrse relationship with her, and another person having a better relationship. Me and my manager started on the exact same day, and a few other colleagues came in thereafter. The person she doesn't have a great relationship with has been here the longest, beore her. The one who has a much better relationship with my manager has somehow ingratiated herself to an extent where she's received promotions ahead of what my other colleagues -- even the one who's been here longer than any of us -- have received."
99,"My boss is great. He is the reason I became a manager. I was getting really high scores from customers. When he singled me out and showed me to the bosses they decided it will be a good idea to promote me. I will grateful and we make a great team. We havemutual respect for one another, we show this by the dialogue and how we keep it professional. It is mutual respect that allows us to get far and be able to complete work and have high integrity."
100,"In compared to co-workers my leader supports me in every possible manner. There has been situations when he has been there for me even after working hours to solve my problems.  Besides our formal relationship at work, he is helpful to me in many other asects outside work.  He is so flexible and trusts me a lot. If there is any important task he prefers to appoint me first rather than any body else which shows his trust and respect for me. He is there for any help or coaching required to me at work. One o the main reasons that i enjoy working is my leader because i enjoy working with him. There is no feeling like dissatisfaction or boredom at work due to my leader."
101,"My organization is restructuring and our tasks will be  changing from doing daily operations and project work around the country, to just doing project work for U.S. restricted accounts.  My leader is having difficulty letting go of the daily operations wrk and we are experiencing significant layoffs.  Before all this started my manager allowed to work on what whatever projects I wanted and gave me increasing responsibilities in the department.  He did not provide coaching; I was given these projects/assinments because it was things he did not want to deal with and he knew I could and would.  Now that  the significant layoffs have started, he has shown me that he does not respect me because I'm being targeted for lay off.  If someone is part of his ""good le boy"" network then he has a really good relationship with him and he's doing whatever he has to do to ensure they are safe in the company.  Even if their work ethic is questionable."
102,"My manager is very standoffish.   She doesn't take the time out to get to know the workers personally.  She is only interested in results.  You will only hear from her when something goes wrong.  When you are doing a great job you won't hear any praise bu if you do something wrong she then wants to talk to you.  I don't feel like my efforts are appreciated at all.  I feel that if a worker is helping the company to make money, that employee should be appreciated and made to feel like they matter.  If a worer takes the time out to do all that they can to work, the supervisor should take notice of this.  I don't think that the supervisor that I have really even makes note of good things, only things that don't matter.  For example, if I do well in the sales epartment she won't say a word that week.  Two weeks later if I fall behind in sales, she will then send an email to me saying ""she needs  to see me.""  If I did well all the time I would literally never hear from her.  It is very sad that it is this way bt it really is this way. 

My supervisor does not take the time out to find out what my needs are.  She is only interested in exploiting any problems that I may have in order to make herself to appear smarter or better than the rest of us.  I have never flt close to her or that she would ever try to help me out of any type of bind.  I would never even ask her for a favor because I know that she wouldn't go out of her way to do anything for anyone other than herself.  She is not a people person so I don't now why she is a manager in the first place.  This doesn't seem right to me at all."
103,"My leader is a very competent intelligent, hardworking person.  He is very knowledgeable about the job he has to perform and does it very efficiently. He had a great personality and is well-liked by employees. He provides  everyone and that includes me wih the skills needed to complete a job. If their is need for coaching instructions, he makes sure his employees get it. He is caring and concern about all his workers, he treats them in an equal fair manner.  My co-workers admire him so much, they try to d a very good job pleasing him.  My leader informs us of   policies and  informs us on the effects that will have on us.  He makes sure our working area is safe and secure."
104,"My leader is stern yet fair. He provides the know how in order to succeed but it may not be clear all of the time. In the beginning I received much support and training but now it's more of a hands off support. Even though, when I see him, he gives me a sile and asks me how I'm doing and performing. He relies on the fact that the training he gave me provides the foundation of my work. Along with reliability, he sees in me dedication to the job beyond the money involved. Being management just under him, I'e spent the most time with him and am thus the closest. To summarize, I've been granted the opportunity and responsibility to manage the problems within my ability."
105,"My boss at work is really a remarkable guy. He didn't start out as a manager, but worked his way up to being one so he knows all the in's and out's of every job. He's been with the company for many years and knows what it's like having problems. He listen to everyone (he literally never shuts his office door so you can just walk in and talk) and does his best to make ""work"" not seem like ""work"". If he can't figure something out or doesn't have a good answer, he takes time off of work to call someone abovehimself and resolve things himself, for you. The other co-workers all seem to like the boss as well, as he doesn't just save this attitude for myself or another, but shares it with everyone equally."
106,"I have very little interaction with my leader. Thankfully my position does not require very much supervision or direction. However, we interaction is needed it can be very difficult to get the needed time from him, he often will miss scheduled times to tak as well. I think that most people I work with have a very similar relationship with him as I do. He does try to be motivational and provide valuable information, but when you need something from him it can prove difficult to get the time you need. He shws more in word than in deed that he respects me. Overall we have a good relationship, but I get most of what I can done without him."
107,I have a great relationshup with my leader. He always coaches me and the entire staff so that we could be better educators. He respects us because he always ciritiques us in private but loves to publicly give us praises. I have a closer relationshup to hi than most of my colleagues because I am the chairperson for our insrtructional team.
108,"My boss is great at playing to the strengths of each of our employees. When someone is hired on, after they are trained, my boss takes the time to chat with them, figure out what they are best at and what they enjoy doing the most, and then works with the to set them up to do more of those types of things. I believe she treats all of our employees equally, and there has been no display of favoritism."
109,"My leader provides us with weekly training for the entire organization. There are many of us who are able to have coaching calls and other communications with my manager. My leader does not do a great job in showing respect to me. My relationship with my eader is not as good as my coworkers. I do not feel entirely appreciated, and in fact it seems to be there is some issue between us, though I do not know what it is."
110,"My leader gives me the opportunities I need to work independently and grow and learn how to better and more efficiently how to do my job. However, he is always available for me to ask questions to improve myself if I don't know how to do something the bes way possible, because he recognizes that the outcome is more important than the method."
111,My manager doesn't provide much coaching. He expects me to figure out how to do things. He is always willing to give me a direction when I have a question. My manager has a more professional relationship with me. He has a more friendly and personal relatinship with other people in the department because eh ahs worked with them longer.
112,"my leader is very good, he directs me to do the right thing and he is fair in the tasks he gives me to do. i enjoy working for him and I am happy to come to work every day. he treats me with respect and treats my coworkers the same also. i feel as if my lader is very good at doing his job and I do not regret working under him"
113,My boss provides coaching in the way of encouragement in wanting me to do better and continue improving in my abilities by assigning me more work tasks and more challenging projects. He shows respect for me by not making me drive a bigger truck than what  am comfortable with. I drive a small truck for work to transport hazardous waste and I am not comfortable driving a bigger one and he does not make me since I help out in many other ways that the other drivers do not help out with. Other relationships hehas- two guys- they swear at each other and often argue but then in his own ways of apologizing or giving back to them he gives one more freedom in lack of work duties and the other takes out to lunch.
114,"My working relationship with my leader is exemplary.  Since we have been working together now for almost two decades there is very little coaching and development at this point but they always provided it earlier in our careers.  My leader respects my exprtise greatly, always deferring to me to advise or even make decisions when it involves my personal work experience.  My relationship with my leader is slightly better than the leader has with other coworkers due to our longevity of working together, but therwise my leader treats everyone the same."
115,People who have been there longer probably get more attention or reciprocation than I do. My manager expects me to learn more on my own and does not neccesarily return favors. I don't know how he would. I am shown respect mainly by being able to choose myown hours. When I have something personal to do I can take the day off without problems. I am given freedom with my hours and sometimes I can choose which tasks to complete before others depending on what it is.
116,"I think that he respects me because he asks me what happened before he assumed I did something wrong. He likes to get a perspective first. However, he doesn't do much in the way of coaching. I think that's because he doesn't really know what's going on. Ithink my coworkers have a greater understanding, so they're better resources."
117,"The chairmen is our department leader who I report directly to. He sets and holds a hide standard. With this he gives a lot of freedom for us to complete our work at our own pace and skill. If you are not producing, we will put the hammer down but other tan that he is very supportive and if I need any assistance he will get it done."
118,"My leader does an excellent job cultivating an independence in my practice. To do this, she takes time to correct my deficiencies and provides real-time feedback on how to improve for the next assignment. She takes time out of her schedule to go over assinments in details. She provides this same level of insight with other co-workers while they are on service with her."
119,"My leader shows that she trusts me. Over the course of the last year she has a propensity to defer decisions to me that show me this trust. I can tell this is a different relationship than what she has with others, but it is beneficial to the both of us. y giving me the ability to decide things, she shows she cares. My leader shows incessantly how much she believes in me by telling me how a good job is done and how she has elevated expectations for me."
120,"My leader doesn't much care for his people. Even when i excel, my leader doesn't appreciate or acknowledge at all how well i'm doing. Couple that with the fact that i don't get pay raises, it's very humiliating and demoralizing at times. It makes it very ard to go to work and do my job. I don't much care to excel anymore because i know he won't care and i will only do the minimum."
121,"My leader provides virtually no coaching/development, and generally makes capricious demands. That said, he does this to our entire team, so I don't take it personally- he's just a bad manager. We have corporate-dictated progress meetings/development goal, but he ignores them and evades our efforts to get him to abide by policy."
122,I am very lucky because I have a great boss/leader.  He values my work and encourages me.  I enjoy working for a leader that is easy to talk to.  He is very easy to go to with issues and always helps me find resolutions.  He is a good manager to everyone. He is always friendly and easy to approach.  He makes the workday easier and less stressful with his playful and encouraging attitude.  He also does a good job of acknowledging my successes.
123,"My leader has faculty meetings for us every month and that's somewhat coaching.   My leader does not need to show us respect.  My leader has announcements for us everyday that points us in the right direction of what needs to be done.  Also our leader emals us with updates for the week ahead, gives us a schedule of whats going on in sports and other extracurricular activities.  He shows me by being a leader and giving a great vision for the school at which I work.  The relationship with other workers is te same as the one with me."
124,I good relationship with my leader.  He really lets me work with little supervision.  I think he could be more attentive to my needs to make more money.  He does compare very well to other leaders I have worked with.  He does have the skills to lead.  I jst think there is a time when someone needs to also nuture and a lead   it comes down to just helping out
125,"1) My manager, or as we refer to it ""team leader"" doesn't offer coaching to me, as I've been doing my job much longer than he has, and he is comfortable with my judgement. 
2) My team leader calls, texts, and emails me to thank me for accomplishing specifc tasks, or to compliment the manner in which I completed them.
3) My co-workers have a similar relationship with the team leader, though as I am his direct subordinate I have more regular interaction with him."
126,My manager does not need to provide coaching and development. When I was hired it was assumed that I was pre trained and ready to work. My job also entails a skill set that my manager does not have. I know that my manager respects me because he gives me te freedom to do whatever I feel fit to complete my job. My relationship with my manager is cordial but much more formal than it is with my co-workers.
127,"My leader provides me with some amount of coaching, however, the vast majority of my development comes from research I have done outside of work and that can be frustrating as he will just tell me to figure something out and it will be much harder a task han he thinks it is. To be fair though, my leader often shows praise and respect for me, and I would say the respect shown is comparable to my co-workers."
128,"I would describe my working relationship with my manager as extremely positive. The coaching he provides does help me actualize my goals, and the respect shown is great for the workplace. We all work together as one team, one entity, so it's great to havesuch positive relationships with the office. Overall, the experience with both my co-workers and manager and the workplace in general is extremely positive."
129,"I have a you leave me alone, I'll leave you alone relationship with my supes. They have no real power to do anything about anything here anyways. Everything is so tied up in the union and bureaucratic bs that its a pointless position. They can threaten mebut the union will protect me from their idiocy. They cant do anything and they know it. So they stay out of my business and let me do my job how I see fit, and I try not to make excessive work for them. Its an understanding that works for us."
130,"There is no coaching. We talk about what needs to be done that day at the job. We discuss how we will go about doing it and what it the best way. When then both get down to work and if questions arise or concerns throughout the job, we will pause and talkto each other."
131,"My leader provides me as much coaching as I require in order to do my job well. He also occasionally calls me, especially on nights that he knows that I am working late, to make sure I am okay and still motivated.  I think I have a better relationship wit my leader than many of my coworkers because I work harder than my coworkers and my leader respects that."
132,"Provides enough coaching when the situation calls for it. Provides enough development when the situation calls for it. Provides appropriate respect, although there could be more respect shown to boost our confidence higher. Relationship are unequal betwee coworkers and leader as most tend to take leader's considerations first. Seems to not show favoritism although I am not sure."
133,My manager and I work well together but she does like to micro-manage a little too much. Overall she likes telling others exactly how to do things but tries to give incentives. When I have a problem she will help me find a solution. I think my manager truts me more than my coworkers as I am older and have been with the company the longest of anyone there.
134,"1) My project manager allows me to develop my skills and do stuff I'm not familiar with. Not really coaching since he's no expert at what I'm doing at work.

2) Has never yelled at me. I can usually negotiate with him (e.g. have to leave earlier, want to ork remotely, need to have a day off). Gives me positive feedback.

3) I think our relationship is very professional and on the same page as with others."
135,my boss is usually very forthcoming with any new information about the company and the direction in which we are going.If i am doing well my boss will really praise me and anyone on my team for doing well on any job that we are given.he treats every one wth dignity and respect just the same as he does with me.my supervisor really knows how to handle and lead a team and does it without being hated or resented unlike some bosses that i have had in some of my past jobs and positions.
136,"My supervisor is removed from the day-to-day operations of my department, so much that all training is done by other employees. It is difficult to implement effective changes to processes and work flow because of my supervisor's detachment. My supervisor oes not show respect for any employees in that she ignores direct communication, demands overtime, and does not perform employee reviews as required by the company."
137,My boos and I exchange ideas on a daily basis. He often asks for my opinion in matters that occur through out the day. We bounce ideas off of one another and see how they fit into the grander scheme of things. My boss thanks me every day for my contributins to my job.
138,My leader motivates me well in work and guide me well in profession ........... ................ ........ ............ ........... ............... .... ..... .... ..... .... ... ... ... .. ... ...... ...... ..... ..... .... .... .... .... .... .... ..... ... ... .... ..... .... ... ...... ..... ..... ..........
139,"There is very little relationship between myself and my ""leader"".  I'm new to the area I work in and I feel mostly ignored by him.  He will always stop to talk to my coworkers, but I may as well not even be there.  My coworkers are the ones who train me.  have been in this new department for about six weeks now and I am learning my new responsibilities, but little of this training has been from my supervisor.  He seems content to sit back and watch my progress."
140,my relation with my coworker is very good. It is just like my best friend and my well wisher. No one in my life I have git before caring for me soo much. He always provides me coaching and make me learn everything very nicely. My relation is better than ohers workers .
141,"My leader only gives me the mandatory new info from our corporate branches when they mandate it. Otherwise she just does her own thing and doesnt coach or develop anyone. My leader's only concern is about making money and profiting the company, she does nt discuss anything else.I think all of the people at my company have the same relationship with my leader and that is a direct one concerning work and nothing else."
142,"My leader does not provide much coaching but will provide tips or advice whenever I need it. My leader shows me respect by listening to my concerns and treating me with integrity. My relationship with my leader is the same as my co workers. We are all treted fairly without any biases. He does not favor anybody, if your work is good, you will get benefits."
143,"My leader doesn't really coach me or help me develop.  We both have pretty similar job requirements.  The only reason he is my boss is because he has longevity at the company and was given a higher position.  We both do the same things and it's not reallyrelevant for him to coach me.  He does respect me, and I respect him.  We don't respect each other in a leader/subordinate kind of way.  It's more of we respect each other in a professional colleague sort of way."
144,"My manager always show me respect in the office. Also provides incentives for doing more than is described in my work contract. When I need so advice he generally has some to give. Sometimes it is even good advice. There is always a friendly word availabl. I seem to be one of his favorite employees, for example when I want a few hours to myself I get it, most other employees are simply told to get back to work."
145,"I think my relationship with my leader is comparable with that of my co-workers. While there is some feedback, mainly we are expected to work on our own and manage our individual workloads and responsibilities. Obviously, if we make a mistake we hear abou it or if a client is very happy, our leader lets us know."
146,My working relationship with my leader is a very friendly yet professional one. He always takes the time to show me the reasoning behind the decisions as well as explaining to me how to fix problems. My relationship with him is the same as well as my co-wrkers. He treats us all the same and that is with respect and kindness.
147,"He is always available to help me with things I don't know or don't understand. He's usually very nice and understanding when helping me with these things and shows respect like that. Sometimes, he gets frustrated if I do something wrong or if I don't remmber how to do something and then he's short with me but still helps. My coworkers that are good at their jobs or very friendly have better relationships with him than I do -- my coworkers that are worse at their jobs have worse relationships than I do."
148,"My leader doesn't regularly provide feedback or coaching.  She does value my contributions and has given me consistently positive performance reviews.  However, she micromanages my work and wants to be involved in every little decision I make.  She does te same with my teammates and ends up being a huge roadblock to us completing our work."
149,My leaders provides a lot of support and is always helping me on issues I have. My leader always shows that he knows what is going on and makes sure he takes his time with me. Our relationship is much more formal than with my other coworkers in the office I like it here.
150," My relationship with my leader is very one sided. He tells me a lot of the problems with the company and his personal life, but I don't share any of my problems. He does try to teach me different things about the construction industry by showing me exacty what he is trying to do for each project. He also tells me that I have contributed to the company's success and appreciates my efforts. I do believe that my relationship with my leader is very similar to the relationship he has with all other employees,as he is very open about his problems."
151,"My supervisor gives me the coaching I need and then allows me to independently do my work. If I have questions or concerns, I can freely and easily go to her knowing she will attempt to help me or give me answers. I feel respected in that she allows me todo my work without micro-managing me or invading my privacy. My supervisor is equally kind and respectful to all of our coworkers and her other subordinates, but I believe she has a strong sense or reliability in me. She knows I will get my work done."
152,"My leader is very compassionate and caring and will help in any way possible. If I do a favor for her eventually she will do one in return. She values me and my co workers and is always saying nice things. She very rarely yells or has to reprimand us we rspect her as she respects us, she can always be counted on and my co workers feel the same"
153,I've been working with my supervisor for about eight years now.  There wasn't too much coaching since we've been working in the same field for about 15 years. My supervisor lets me do my own thing and set very loose requirements for what I needed cheapo wrk. My relationship to my coworkers compared to my supervisor is more of a friendly role.
154,"My manager is new in the field and does extremely well.  She is very forgiving, has no issues when my co-workers or I need her help with decisions or managing customer relations.  She always has our back.  As well, if my manager needs help, she does not hsitate to get opinions or advice from her employees.  She is possibly the best manager I have ever dealt with, especially considering her young age and length of time in the business."
155,She is very supportive and keeps me going when times are busy.  As far as coworkers go she treats everyone the same and is pretty upbeat most of the times.  She has no problem jumping in and helping when 
156,My leader does not provide me with a lot of coaching themselves. They do give me access to materials for professional development though.  My leader shows respect by understanding that I require a good work life balance.  My relationship with my leader isthe same as with other employees.
157,"When I joined the company, I had little to no experience in my role. Day 2 at my job, my lead took me into a major meeting and told me to run the meeting while he messaged me a few tips and pointers. I feel like they definitely respect me and our entire tam has a relevant relationship with him."
158,My leader always try to keep me up to date on my job's area. She always want me to keep learning to improve my skills. She respects me very much and she tells me the truth no matter how hard it is. She's the same with me and all my coworkers. She treat usfairly and doesn't have favorites.
159,my manager trust and believes in me he is willing to listen to me and my ideals.if he really needs to get things done i am his go to guy i do on occasion stay late if im needed to get things done  and on some occasions he will let me leave early if i needto without holding me accountable
160,"My manager provides me with a minimal amount of coaching, leaving me to figure out what must be done at work. My leader shows average respect by sometimes being a help, and other times, by being a hassle. My relationship to my boss differs from my co-workrs, simply because they have had years of employment with the employer, so this has given them more time to form a personal relationship with the manager."
161,My leader provides some coaching and development but not as much as I like. There are times I feel at a loss because I have not had enough training. It slows my work progress down. When we have a new product is when I feel it the most. Just seems like thee is no urgency on my leader's part to get me up to speed. My leader treats everyone the same way.
162,"My supervisor is polite towards me, and enthusiastic or seems to be about the job. But I don't think that s/he is very caring or concerned about my well-being on the job. S/he seems simply to care about doing a good job for the institution and maybe makin a promotion."
163,"My working relationship with my leader is too good. I am so lucky that my leader provides me a best guidance in each and every field of my work. My leader is a very gentleman person. He always ready to hear our problems and queries. He also solved out it s fast as possible with great efforts. Moreover, we all co-workers have very good bonding with our leader."
164,My manager focus on  the job training by coaching me on specific skills needed to enhance my performance. He appreciate my work by praising me in front of others and shows his respect to me . My relationship is good with my leader with mutual trust   and aving a better relationship than others.
165,"I have a strange relationship with my manager.  She's very concerned about her job security and that fear or worry colors all of her interactions.  It makes many things uncomfortable - my development, my interaction with others in the company - both of whch she wants to monitor and closely watch.  It has made my networking in the company strained and stilted.  But, I like her as a person.  I would even consider her a friend.  This management style is awful and she's so nervous people will go behind her bak or talk negatively about her that she inserts herself in every team member conversation.   She needs some management training."
166,"Sometimes I feel like it is hard to talk to my leader. He plays favorites. He does appreciate my work and thanks me for my hard work. However, he forms friendships with the guys at work that he does not form with me and the other female workers. Additionaly, he often speaks poorly of some of the workers behind their backs. This makes me paranoid about what he really thinks of me."
167,"He is a weak person who doesn't know how to lead. He has always been under the thumb of his older brother who was his boss. He's since semi-retired but is still in the picture and officially my boss is the CEO, but he really isn't in charge. Therefore, hedoesn't command much respect."
168,"My relation with my leader is very positive. I know my leader concern about me and all co worker of my company.While the Leader top priority is likely to have hardworking employees who fulfill his vision for the company, it’s a safe bet that he’d alsolike to have more than superficial relationships with the people he works with every day. After all, he probably spends more time with his staff than he does with anyone else. My leader is much concern about us he help everyone to try best. He respect allthe staff equally. He makes judgement according to work"
169,I have a great relationship with my leader.  She understands my personal situation and is interested in my personal life besides my work life.  She respects me on a similar basis to the other members of our team.  She informes me of areas I need improvemet and areas I'm doing well.
170,I have a decent relationship with my leader. We started out on the wrong foot but our relationship has improved. She doesn't respect me and my wishes as much as I would like. I wish she would consider my input on issues that affect me. I feel she shows a ittle favoritism to certain coworkers.
171,"(1) Our organization leader does not provide coaching and development, that responsibility goes to the managers under him. (2) Our leader always recognizes and speaks to us and treats us with respect. (3) I believe the relationship of our leader and my pers is the same or extremely similar to mine.  He is a very FAIR man."
172,"My manager offers her assistance in the form of an ""open door"" policy.  She encourages any employee who feels that they need guidance to see her.  She constantly reminds us that she used to be where we are and understands some of the challenges that we ma face.  Most employees do take her up on this offer because sometimes situations occur that we did not anticipate and we do appreciate having someone to go to that can answer questions.  We usually pass the information that we learn along to other co-workrs so that if a particular situation arises again, we will know exactly how to handle this.  This method really does come in handy because you find that as the years pass that you have fewer and fewer questions about your job because the question has alredy been answered previously and documented.  Personally, I use sticky notes and other forms of reminders to have needed information handy and ready to use when I need it.  I really don't like going to the supervisor for help because it makes me look incometent.  I like when I can find the solution to a problem on my own without asking for help.  I also like when others that are equal to me come to me for assistance.  I feel that this will help my chances for promotion sometime down the road.  In my opinio, the more others come to you and the less that you go to your supervisor for help, the better it is for you.  The supervisor will remember that you are the one who can work independently and give you a promotion before anyone else.  This is why my relatinship with my supervisor is so professional.  I make sure that I only bother her if I really need to.  I never just crack jokes or bother her for no reason."
173,my leader is always starts the shift asking how im doing  she then has an idea of my mood and show she cares  we work together as a team this way  things get done but wee are happy
174,"My working relationship with my leader is very good. It is two way; a give and take sort of relationship. My leader is helpful, willing to listen and provide feedback, and willing to encourage. My leader treats me and my co-workers equally. We always receve just treatment and are always respected."
175,My leader provides me with all the benifits I need. They show respect by honoring me. All our worker relationships are all the same compared to each other so it is very exciting to be a part of our work force. We are all treated the same by our boss.
176,"I think its fine, If i need help he helps. If other people need help he helps them too. He thinks that if you are working hard you should be rewarded. He is always friendly and courteous when talking to anyone. He puts his job on the line to make sure we et what we deserve, I have personally seen it more than once."
177,My coach and leader provides me with good development in the sense that he is always there to provide me guidance when I need it. He respects me because he pays attention to my opinion and at the same time he keeps a good professional relationship separat from anything inappropriate
178,He will some works not all the time
179,"We have a lot of freedom at my workplace, so my leader gives me a lot of creative freedom to figure out what works best toward accomplishing a goal. She has shown a lot of confidence in me, and the rest of my team as well. I feel lucky that she is not thetype of leader that is constantly hovering."
180,"My leader is focus on giving me the tools I need to make my work efficient. She shows me respect all the time by giving me a thank you note every time a I do something right and when the opposite happens, she explain to me what I did wrong and how to do i better.My relationship is very good, we can talk about anything with respect."
181,"She comes to me for some advice concerning work, but over all it's her decision. We have little bit of personal relationship but over all it's more work related. She shows preference to other workers because I don't kiss ass as a few of my co-workers do. ike I wanted to go to another department where I could have made more money, but in our company you can only leave if your supervisor allows you to and she made sure that wasn't going to happen."
182,My team leader provides good coaching and monthly one on one meetings with every member of our team. She treats us all with respect and handles issues in private rather than in team chat. I have had some personal issues come up that I have been able to beopen with my leader about and she has been very understanding. Our team leader is always great with helping us out.
183,I get a long well with my leader.  He provides a lot of coaching and development.  I can tell that he respects me.  I think I get along with him better than he gets a long with my coworkers because we are close to the same age and have the same experience and stuff.
184,"Well my leader had been in the game for about 20 years  so he knows what he is doing. He is very knowledgeable, and explains things in a way that you understand it and you don't feel dumb but actually smart"
185,I have a very mutual relationship with my boss. She is a very nice and understanding person who seems to care about most everyone she is in charge with. Whenever someone has a problem or question she is always very understanding and very helpful to us all She does a wonderful job as a supervisor and I value her very much.
186,my leader is an ass with no respect for me at all he takes credit for my work and blames me for his errors the only reason i keep working there is i need the money so my leader takes advantage of me because he knows this about my life
187,"My leader respects my output so doesn't provide much in the way of coaching and development. I've been doing the job for 15 years and am pretty good at it. This ability to work unfettered is how my leader shows me respect.  I have a good working relationsip with my leader, as do most staff members."
188,My leader doesn't see me as an equal in the organization and looks down upon me as an employee. My leader thinks they know everything and typically refuses to listen to any of my suggestions. My co-workers seem to be more well respected and receive favorseven when I don't.
189,"We don't have any sort of formal, or even informal, system for coaching and development. I feel like I get none. I'm not sure he respects me. I mean, he doesn't come right out and make fun of me or anything, but I get the feeling that my relationship withmy supervisor isn't anywhere near as important and satisfying to me as it is to other people in my group."
190,"Our leader did put a lot of effort into training us at the start of our job. He is very respectful towards the employees, also very strict and precise. In and out of the working environment we have a very good and friendly relationship and he has helped m alot in various situations."
191,I am the main cook at a college. I run the whole kitchen. I do have a boss that taught me every thing I need to do. After he taught me everything I needed to do he has basically just left me alone to run the kitchen. I am good at my job and he will check n every once in a while to check things out but everything is always good in my kitchen.
192,"I receive little coaching from my supervisor, she works in an office on a different floor and rarely interacts with her employees on a day-to-day. She has the same relationship with all employees; she seems to respect us, but does not communicate with us ften enough to really show it."
193,"1. My 'leader' is less of a coach and more of a goal focused individual.  My coworkers and I are heads down, get it done types who require little coaching. 
2. My leader understands that my team and I work better when left alone, and doesnt try to change hat.
3. we all have a similar relationship with the leader."
194,My leader does not provide direction to anyone and does not properly train the employees. Our relationship is small and does not consist of much communication as i disagree with his managerial style. He respects my efforts but has very low standards of woking when it comes to employees and other leaders in the store.
195,Not so much coaching as giving information on what the customer needs or wants serviced on project. gives me more guidelines to work with. as total cost and such. He always appreciates my work and says so to me and customers. get alot of praise. although he owner of the shop doesn't seem to want to pay me accordingly. He treats all the employees with respect. Even the ones slacking.
196,"my co-worker is very nice person , and  he is very perfect ,his coaching is very convenient for both, than very respectable person , not spacial relationship ,all of same,not compare to other person , he organized any body meeting , and spacial occasion ,e are all enjoy because of best co-worker"
197,"person with short-term or long-term responsibility — in the latter sense, usually a generic term; also, one given responsibility over an estate someone in authority or control, as a manager or supervisor or a politician who does not have official statusas leader of a political entity but has the actual power."
198,"My leader is honestly not big on coaching and development. I would like to see more of it. That being said, she is good at showing respect. She will ask my opinion and values my feedback which she does not do for everyone.

I think I have a similar relatinship with my leader compared to others on my team. There are those on other teams that she does not treat as well as she does our team."
199,My manager has weekly meeting where I can discuss my current work and also discuss developmental opportunities.Compared to other team mates I believe my manager holds me in higher regard because I have managed my work load without complaint. He will call r email whenever there are decisions to be made that impact our team and solicits my feedback.
200,"I have had the same direct supervisor for over 8 years. she is an awesome boss and a very hard worker. she shows me constantly how much she appreciates and respects me. she is very willing to help me if i need to learn something new. because i have workedwith my boss for many years we have a special relationship. i have a more trust in her that my co workers, some because they are newer and some because they aren't very competent. I really do trust her the most of anyone in our 400 plus employee business."
201,My organization has coaching and development opportunities available and my leader provides approval for most of the development opportunities or coaching. My leader behaves normally to me and a mutual respect is between me and manager. Manager doesn't shw that he respect me and I have not felt as well. My leader behaves the same to all even though sometimes he shows favoritism to few team members.
202,My leader provides a moderately high amount of coaching and mentoring to assist my development.  My leader very strongly shows that she respects me and the work that I do.  My coworkers also have a strong relationship with my leader and she provides them oaching and development assistance as well as shows them a high level of respect.
203,"my leader is very energetic and very care to person in my coworkers,and very respect in each situation,sometimes he angry mind but he said the causally happy to the talking with others.my relationship is friendly person to my leader.one time i give the wrng work in my company but he give  pardon ."
204,"I DO NOT HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH MY BOSS.  MY BOSS OFTEN TIMES WILL BE DISRESPECTFUL AND DEMANDING.  MY BOSS WANTS TO LOOK GOOD HERSELF AND WILL OFTEN TAKE CREDIT FOR THINGS THAT SHE DID NOT INSTIGATE OR ACCOMPLISH.  MY CO-WORKERS ARE DIVIDE IN THEIR SUPPORT OF MY MANAGER. THOSE WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE SEE HER AS A USER, THOSE WITHOUT A DEGREE, LIKE THE MANAGER, SUPPORT THE MANAGER."
205,"I think the working relationship with my leader is fair.  I would not hang out with them on the weekend, but I can be friendly with them.   I appreciate that they will say thank you and please when making requests.  They don't just act like a tyrant.  I tink they treat everyone with the same courtesy."
206,My leader is very supportive of my decisions and is also very willing to help and assist me with any questions or issues that I may have. We discuss detail in depth with future plans or goals for our company as well as ways to implement them seamlessly. H never hesitates to praise accomplishments.
207,"I am very familiar with the policies and procedures related to my position however, when something comes up that I am unfamiliar with, my leader takes the time necessary to acquaint me with whatever it is and is sure to follow up to make sure I am understnding whatever it was.

He always recognizes when I go above and beyond, accomplish something challenging, etc.. and often talks about where my career is/will/should go and what it takes to get there.

My manager treats all employees equally and fairly."
208,"I would call the relationship with my manager that of working friends. While they are in a position of authority we keep it cordial in the workplace. I know when it is time to buckle down and do the work, and my leader knows when they should play the roleof friend and the role of a leader."
209,"My leader/manager is very concerned about how my job is done.  So, I make sure I do my job well.  When I do my job well, I'm praised for it.  She and I have a mutual respect for each other, as it's not good to be on the bad side of your leader.  My relatinship with my manager is a little more professional, than with my co-workers."
210,I have a great working relationship with my supervisor. He often asks me to attend meetings with him so I can learn more skills. He shows that he respects me by giving me new projects and not micro managing. He seems to have the same type of relationship ith my other co-workers.
211,My supervisor doesn't have to coach me often but often makes compliments towards my completed work. She asks me for my opinion in some department decisions sometimes that helps me to feel respected. She is often more soft spoken with me than my co-workersbecause I can be a little sensitive at times.
212,"My working relationship with my leader is excellent. My leader provides me with no coaching and development, because that's not his job. His expertise is management, while mine is technical. My leader behaves in a consistently respectful way towards me. H also behaves in a consistently respectful way towards other employees under his management. Overall, this individual is a very effective leader who has a good relationship with everyone, and is very respectful of everyone's needs. He communicates very clarly, and takes other people's priorities into account when making decisions. Overall I'm pretty happy to be working for this leader."
213,"My leader is that in title only. I get very little to no guidance or advice from my leader. My leader has almost no real power as he is the CEO in title only and answers to his big brother who retired several years ago. No one has much respect for him, an he knows it. He doesn't attempt to provide any sort of leadership because he knows no one will take it to heart because he is so weak. I do feel sorry for him, but he has had many opportunities to stand up for himself and hasn't done so."
214,"My boss asks about my work, provides on the job training, and often rewards me with lunches when I do well. He respects my decisions and gives me  a lot of autonomy. If I have an issue, his office door is always open to me. If i have a family or health crsis he always gives me time off or allows me to telecommute from home. He appears to treat all employees in the same manner. He cares as much about us as he does the business and bottom line. He speaks to me in a manner that shows he does not feel he is aove me,"
215,My leader and I are kind of close.  We get along and she looks out for my best interests.  She is the best leader I have had compared to all the other leaders I have had in my life.  She is kind and caring.  She loves all her employees that she oversees. We all agree that she is a great leader.  Everyone here pretty much gets along and does the best work they can do.  No one wants to do a bad job.  I don't know what would happen if someone did a bad job because I haven't seen it happen.
216,"At my company there are many tools to help us learn and improve our performance, and my leader helps contribute to these tools and encourages use of them. My leader also seeks out info to help improve these tools. Everyone is treated equally and expected o use the learning tools as we see fit, but the onus is on us to perform and if we are able to do so without using the tools, fine, but if our performance falters, we will lose our job. This is a produce or perish organization, and any learning is up to te person, but it is necessary to be able to perform well."
217,"My leader leads the best by example.  He doesn't provide great direction in terms of where the organization is going, but my immediate manager gets down in the trenches with us and does the work.  He's very good at showing us what needs to be done and givng us the tools to do things in spite of not always delivering a clear direction.  Because of his efforts and our efforts, the job always does get done in a timely fashion because we are all willing to put in lots of hard work.  He shows he respects us beause he works with us, and he treats us all in the same way."
218,My manager and I have a good relationship.  I have been working with my manager for quite a few years now and I have come to depend on him for his support.  He regularly asks me if I need assistance with anything and is usually available when I have questons regarding any work assignments.  He has an open door policy so I can basically reach him at anytime if I need any coaching or help.  He shows that he respects me by actually listening to my ideas and actually implementing some of them.  He does with al of his workers.
219,"Six days each year we have coaching sessions.  These last for about 2-3 hour sessions.  My leader shows that he respects me by allowing me to just do my job with little to no interference.  He knows I do my job and he knows I do my job well.  So he just lts me do my job without constantly looking over my shoulder.  My relationship with my leader is about the same as my co-workers.  We can joke and carry on.  However, there are a few of my co-workers whom I feel get a little more special treatment from himthan I do."
220,"My manager is really good at taking the time to make sure I understand what I need to do and answer any questions I may have about how to do it. When I need time to learn a new program, he will give it to me a couple  of days in advance so I can become failiar with it before it is time to use it at work. He treats everyone at the office the same way. He really does seem to care about making sure we all can do our jobs to the best of our abilities and he helps us get the best results."
221,"i have a reasonable woking relationship with my boss and or leader. we have taken classes for improvement togethoer and have devloped a really close bond with one another, working on how things could run much much more smoother in the work place. We have  simmilaiar relationship as our coworkers however he does have to be the boss and do what needs to be done at any given time. he dosent command people he just askes nicely and it helps with the overall modd of the whole situation and makes for a much muchbetter work place for us all."
222,"I don't think there's much to say about this. The only supervisor type people I have simply act as middle men for the data I produce. Of course they all help whenever I might be able to use it, but it's a pretty rare thing for that to happen. They're alwas courteous to me though. They're quick to answer any questions and always show a lot of appreciation whenever I do something for them. I don't think I have any type of special relationship though. They just treat me well like everyone else, same way I an others treat them well."
223,My supervisior is always willing to show me new things and teach me he is there for me when there is good times and bad times. I do not have to worry about my spervisior letting me down I can always count on him. If another person or employee at my work hs a problem my supervisior is there to help them as well so He tries to take care of everyone at work and is not limited to helping out just one employee. All in all I feel that my supervisior is one of the best people I could work for.
224,They offer training whenever I request it or need it. If I ever need a day off I can usually get it unless too many other people have off already. They ask for my input on almost every decision and if I think anything should change or not. If I go out of y way to work on a project they will notice it and bring it up in my review. Some of my co-workers do not get along with my manager as well as I do but I believe it is because they are difficult people to get along with anyways and they complain a lot. I et a assignment and just do it without complaining.
225,"My leader has been very supportive of my goals and he is very communicative. He often presents me with challenging work that I enjoy and reasonable expectations for completion. He also directs me towards ways to improve myself in a constructive fashion. H is very good at balancing my needs with everyone else in our workplace and he does a good job multitasking and making sure that my priorities and needs are met through a busy schedule. He also is very friendly and always has a smile on his face. He workshard, but also recognizes that having fun is important and he does a very good job making sure the work environment is a good place."
226,"My leader is a great mentor to me.  He meets with me individually every two weeks to ensure I am prepared for my various tasks and goals.  He listens to my concerns and pushes me in a positive manner to be my best.  He values my strengths and incorporatesthem into my job responsibilities.  I think that every direct report of my supervisor has a positive relationship with him, as he in genuinely a good, honest and thoughtful man.  I do, however, feel that he and I have a slightly different relationship as  am the same age as his daughter, so our conversations and bond sometimes takes on the father/daughter role."
227,"I have a pretty good relationship with my manager. He doesn't treat me better or worse than my co-workers. He does like to give praise when one of the team members does really well and excels above expectations. He doesn't make me or anyone else feel bad ut he lets that worker know that they are appreciated. I am able to communicate really well with my manager. He is an easy person to talk to. When I have questions, he is good about finding the answer. If he doesn't know right away, he will find the answe eventually to help me out."
228,"I would say that I have a good relationship with my leader.  I have been with the company for years and never had any real problems with him.  He is the one who has some bad mood swings and wants to take it out on me.  I don't like to be screamed at, cussd at for someone else's mistake.  If I ever make a mistake I will be the first one to own up to it.  People need to be more understanding and calm of their feelings before they take it out on someone else that had nothing to do with it."
229,"My leader gives me as much coaching and development as is necessary although there is not a lot needed as our jobs are rather basic. She respects me and all of the team members at the  store. She is very considerate and nice to all of us. I don't know of nyone who is not very happy to work for her. All other co-workers respect and like our leader. In being respectful of the workers, she is getting back 300% in her investment as everyone is anxious and willing to do a great job for her and for the store."
230,"My relationship with my leader is not very strong, but she has a large sense of trust in me, so she doesn't check up on me all of the time. She is there when I need something and always provides feedback, but on a day to day basis she spends more time wit other coworkers. I take this as a point of pride because she knows I can handle a task once it is given to me and I don't need a whole bunch of hand holding throughout my daily and weekly work assignments. Sometimes that's frustrating, but most of the tie I enjoy the independence."
231,"The relationship between my leader and I is rather great. I receive quite a fair amount of coaching and help along the way without ever being talked down to or condescended. I would say that our relationship compares equally to my fellow co workers relatinship with our leader - the leader is a fair and balanced kind of person and not one to really show favoritism. Overall, I really enjoy my relationship with my boss and he seems to really like working with me too. He even once told me that I was a godsendafter fixing some critical issue with some websites."
232,"My leader encourages me to take part in different events and training that will enhance my abilities as a member of our organization. She urges me to get involved in our organization and take initiative when I see a gap that can be filled. 

My leader shos that she respects me by giving me a lot of leeway to perform my job tasks. She does not hover, or micromanage. She trusts me to complete a job satisfactorily and quickly, and does not feel the need to watch over every step. This lets me know she respect me as a person and an employee.

My relationship with my leader is probably a little more professional than that of some of the other coworkers in our organization. I like not to mix too much with coworkers on personal matters, as I think this muddies th water. My leader does like to gossip and talk with other coworkers, but this always concerns me a bit. We have a good working relationship, and we chat and enjoy talking with one another, but we do not get together outside work."
233,"1) Very little, we only have annual meetings where I am able to receive feedback and constructive criticism. These are 30 minute meetings and I generally just get positive feedback and my concerns aren't really addressed.
2) We don't really interact enoug to show respect. I had a medical issue and they asked a while later if I was ok, so that was nice. But my work concerns are rarely addressed.
3) My coworkers have a much better relationship. My leader interacts with them much more on a voluntary basis an have a closer and more personal relationship that I do not have."
234,"my current relationship with my manager is good,he give me instruction as needed and always giving order with good intention and clear. he does anything for our company good sake,and i hope that i could please him as much his effort to the company.he was lways nice to literally everyone thats why he get the manager job because my company is one of the best company around my place. he give respect to all of company workers and never come late,so do i.one time hes so pissed because of bad works by us but hemanaged to calm down in no time"
235,"I think we have a decent relationship, although it can sometimes be tense when we disagree. I don't get much coaching or professional development assistance from my leader, mostly because she is too busy and over-committed to pay attention. I think I havea better relationship with her than other colleagues in the office, mainly because we spend more time together and she relies on me more for certain tasks than others in the office. My leader generally shows me respect by listening to what I say and not iterrupting me in public. She also shows respect by allowing me some leeway in how I manage my own workload and direct reports."
236,"I don't know how to say it other than my manager is a dick.    He is arrogant, impatient, constantly belittles other, though luckily not me.  I don't think he really respects anybody, but he does suck up to upper management big time.  He trods on people blow him.  He gives no coaching or developments at all...though the company actually promotes and provides resources for this.  Nobody gets along with my manager...except possible some in upper management.  Everyone dislikes him.  My situation is differentin that I am in charge of a section of the plant that nobody else can do."
237,"My manager would like to coach me, but really does not have any expertise in the area of his business.  He is also the owner and really just takes the title of manager for the income.  He does not really know how to use technology.  He is supportive of myefforts and extremely appreciative.  I have turned his company around and he is grateful.  He allows me to have flex-time which I really appreciate.  He tries to assist me when he can, but is demanding in that his own tasks must come above mine and he oftn requires my help."
238,"Overall, I sometimes feel my manager is overwhelmed. I often feel that because I am a strong, dependable, competent employee, I get neglected because management spends so much time dealing with less competent employees. That often makes me feel almost invsible. If more attention was given to the ""good"" employees and the work they were doing, I think work would feel more balanced. In the end, I often feel like I'm taken for granted. But I realize I was hired to do a job and I shouldn't really expected to rceive special treatment just for doing what I was hired to do."
239,"My leader and I have a good working relationship. She provides me with help and teaches me certain things she has learned over the course of her career in the field we work in. She is tough on me at certain times, but she shows me an adequate amount of repect and expects me to perform my job well. I feel as if she treats me a little differently because she holds me to high standards. She sometimes spends more time talking with me than others because she cares about me and admires the amount of work I put n. I am thankful for our relationship and we both learn a good deal from each other."
240,"My manager doesn't seem to notice when I do good work and because of this, I don't think he has much respect for me.  He regularly belittles me or finds fault in things I have done (and usually he does this in front of other people), but doesn't do the sae to others in the department. I will ask for guidance or bounce ideas off of him and will then come back with a finished project and will tell me that I need to redo it even though I have just completed based on our discussion of the project. It is very rustrating, especially when others note that this happens."
241,"My manager asses my performance and guides me in the areas where i am weak and need to work on, for example he helps me by giving suggestions as to how should i handle the clients concern etc.
My Manager gives me my space, understands my vies and opinionsand considers them , if there is any changes to be made that I have suggested he does the needful.
My relationship with my manager is above average when compared to my co-workers, for example there was an instance where my colleague was discussing his peronal issues for being late to work with my manager but my manager insisted to keep it upto a professional level, where as the other day i was late and explained my manager he did not create an issue out of it"
242,"We have a great leader. He is always patient to show us things if we can't quite get it. He is very understanding and if he knows something is going on at home he won't wait for us to ask us to be off but comes to us and tells us if we need to be off a fe days then it is ok. If, and this is rarely, there is a conflict at work he manages to work it out with both sides feeling they have one and never harboring ill will towards the other. Hew is just a boss anyone could work under. He is a gem and they are fw and far between."
243,"My supervisor does not provide any coaching or development for my job.  My supervisor does not know my job or what I do on a day to day basis. My supervisor shows respect by leaving me to do my job.  He does not interfere or have any input very often.  I m good at my job and he just leaves me to it. My relationship with my supervisor is less than others in the company.  There are a few people who try to be his best friend and are his ""pets"".  I am not the type of person to suck up to the boss just to be te favorite."
244,"when I first took this position about 6 years ago I could honestly say that yes she provided a lot of leadership and showed me a lot about my current position. It's somewhat of an accounting position and I had 0 accounting experience when I got promoted t this position. So I was very grateful at the time for the promotion. However, as time has gone on now over the years my pay hasn't really increased as quickly as I thought it would initially and not only that but I also feel like the effort that I put inisn't reciprocated back to me in any way at all."
245,My coach provides excellent coaching and communication skills towards me. They are very attentive and will demonstrate an authentic kind interest in my work for the benefit of the whole.They give me advice and coach me to better me overall and for the bes of the whole. We plan together and in meetings I am put at the same level as the bosses because my leader allows me to be in the same are with his motivation. I really look forward to working with my leader on a daily basis to get better and reach highergoals as a company and a professional team
246,"We have worked together long enough now that he knows what I am capable of and knows what he can expect from me.  He knows I have the necessary experience and can be counted on to make the correct decisions in most situations.  He does not babysit me but nstead lets me work the way I want to work.  In this way, he lets me know that he respects my decisions and does not second guess me. When I need help, he is willing to guide me in the right direction.  He definitely trusts my judgement more than others tat we work with.He"
247,I have a great relationship with my leader. I'm able to go to him if I'm having any problems with my work. He tells me about different opportunities in order to advance my career. My leader has become a friend in a sense. My co-workers are not as close tomy leader as I am. I have been with the company for 4 years so that's why I believe we have come to have a closer relationship than others. My leader is like a mentor to me. Sometimes I have heavy workloads and he will help me out if it's too much for me.
248,My immediate boss is actually my partner in the business.  He is the majority stakeholder and hence I am responsible to him for day-to-day operations of my organization.  He is a visionary with a very clear insight about what the organization goals and diects me accordingly.  I enjoy working with him as it gives me a lot off learning and I am getting to understand the business in a much better way.  I do have my own ideas and we do have conflicts at times but then we manage to resolve them easily and findsolutions which are in the best interest of the organization.
249,My relationship with my leader is very close. We have worked together for a long time and have become good friends in the process. I am always her first choice when there is anything outside of the normal scope of our work that needs to be handled or a ne project someone needs to be in charge of. I know it bothersome to others but I can not change the way she has faith in me and my abilities. I think it is something I earned through all of the previous work we have done together. I often recommend or put n a good word for others with her but she trust my track record.
250,"I have had a change in manager in the last 6 months, so I am still getting to know my current manager. My current manager is new to the company, so has not been able to provide leadership/development specific to our internal procedures, but has been able o provide some leadership on industry specific practices. My old manager did not take very much time in training me, even though they did have experience at my company. I don't feel like I have had enough training in the almost 3 years I have been with th company, but I don't like asking for help or showing weakness. I don't want to look unqualified for my job, so I often waste a lot of time trying to figure things out on my own. 

My current manager shows respect for me by listening to my concerns and prviding non-judgemental feedback/direction.  

From what I can tell, other team members relate to my manager in a similar way, with one exception. One team member is older than everyone else, including the manager, and is struggling with a cancer diagnosis She is having a hard time in response to changes in procedure that our new manager is implementing. She wants to revert to what she has always done, rather than be forced to do something new. It is a very stressful situation for everyone."
251,"We have been working together for a very long time, about ten years, so we know each other pretty well. They do give me a good amount of couching but not as much as they used to because I have been there so long. My leader shows respect by treating me lik a friend. I have a good relationship with my leader because we have known each other for so long. However, they are pretty nice to everyone and not just me. Even people who just started get treated like family there. It is a pretty good environment to wok in."
252,"One - To be honest have very little input with them, they are there if needed for guidance and support. However the working relationship is good and if need anything they are avaliable, they generally do not give me to much work. 

Two - Treats me as an eual and asks opinions on how best to complete tasks and leaves me to get on with the job at hand.

Three - Treats all employess the same and regualrly asks for contributations from others, everybody seems to get on fairly well as a team but most fo the wok is individdual."
253,"My supervisor allows me to have a significant amount of autonomy in my work. By allowing me to have control, my supervisor shows that he respects and trusts my judgment. Essentially, my supervisor broadly informs me of workplace goals, but he allows me todictate the means and methods that are used to achieve specific outcomes. Because of this, I have never doubted that he respects my decision making abilities. Because of my position in the workplace, I have a closer relationship with my supervisor compare to other employees; I basically act as a channel of communication between him and other workers. This shows me that my supervisor feels as though he can trust me to communicate ideas and information to others in an effective manner."
254,"I have a good relationship with my supervisor.  She's about 15 years older than me, and some parts of our relationship are matronly and some parts are as peers.  She does try to steer me toward career achievements in general, but we work for the state, an there aren't that many opportunities to really advance.  I think she does respect my intellect.  She brings all sorts of technical problems to me, because she knows that I have pretty good problem solving skills.  The fact that she uses my abilities so fequently, lets me know she does respect me to some extent.  I'd say my relationship with her is similar to others in that she is a rather calm person, and all her interactions are similar because of that.  But all the people that report to her are differet, so there are differences."
255,"My relationship with my leader is a positive one. My leader is there to support, encourage, listen, give feedback-whether positive or negative, and to help out in any way that they can. My leader is open to feedback and listens well. My leader tries to inorporate our thoughts and ideas into areas that will be beneficial overall. My leader respects me and my co-workers at all times. My leader is fair and treats all of the individual workers with respect and equality. My co-workers and I have the same respet for our team leader and we don't have anything bad to say about her."
256,"My leader tends to take a very hands off approach with me. I've had the same job for almost 20 years so I don't really need a lot of input. By telling me what needs done, and then letting me do it on my own I feel that's one of the best ways of showing tht he respects me and my work. Our relationship is closer than the other employees, but I think that a lot of that has to do with how long we've worked together. I don't really get better treatment than anyone else, but I do get more leeway to do things myway because he knows that they'll get done correctly and on time."
257,"My leader always shows me respect and has never made me feel like my work wasn't appreciated. I know that the reason I am not reciprocated for what I do a lot of the time is because he is so busy. His relationship with other co-workers is also great, everone thinks we have a great leader. The coaching he provides is wonderful in that if I ask to talk to him he always stops what he is doing to answer me and gives me the resources or opportunities for training that I need to advance in my career. He also inorms me of classes and things of that sort that he thinks would benefit me."
258,"My leader is basically there to make sure the job gets done. They do not have time to take personal traits or values into consideration much at all. I am totally replaceable in their eyes. I get basic instruction on what task is needed to be done, then ocasional checkups to see if the task is being completed in an acceptable manner. The only respect that most of us are shown is that we get paid for our work. If you go above and beyond what others do, that's nice, but you will get nothing extra in return.  am constantly helping other employees out by helping lift and carry heavy items and unloading trucks and moving heavy pallets when other employees do not. I do not get any special treatment or recognition. It is almost expected of me to do these things."
259,My relationship is poor. I do not get coaching. I get told what to do in a snarky manner. My boss rarely shows me any respect in his behaviors. Some of my co-workers have a better relationship with my boss because they like to tell on others for any littl thing no matter how small. Others have the same type of relation ship I have. He shows most of us little respect to our faces. He lies to most of us frequently. We laugh to ourselves because we know how dishonest he is. He causes problems by trying to tun people against each other.
260,"My leader provides me with enough coaching and development as it is needed. My leader often times is involved in much larger tasks than I am involved in, and as a result, my leader often does not focus on coaching with employees. Other coworkers often proide most of the coaching and development. My leader respects my opinions because he listens to me when I have questions or concerns. I have a good relationship with my leader because of my effectiveness at work and willingness to work as a team. Most of m coworkers also have a good relationship with my leader. They are all hard workers as well."
261,"My former supervisor would say that I work well as a part of a team, as well as being motivated on my own.  At that particular company, it was important to be able to keep all the team members informed, as we worked collaboratively on many sales. It was a interesting environment, and I found it enjoyable and challenging.  We were responsible for our sales from first contact to the close, and worked alone and independently most of the time. There were some experienced sales people who had a difficult time ith the lack of structure there, but I found it satisfying to have that kind of autonomy."
262,"once a month I receive a coaching on what I need to work on and what I am doing well. I am also told what is expected in the future and what to look forward to and how I can help more. They respect me by allowing me time for school and studying, as well a giving me tips on how to make more money per paycheck. I feel that my team leader and I have a good professional and personal relationship. My needs and wants are completely understood and taken seriously, while also creating a fun and enjoyable work envronment."
263,"Due to the nature of the job, there isn't much in regards to mentorship or development on the part of my manager. His job function differs pretty greatly from my own. However, there is a path toward management that can be sought out and he has demonstrate willingness to help out with getting a candidate package put together. He has allowed me to take training in areas not immediately relevant to my current assignment, but that furthers my goals of where I want to move in my career. He shows respect for methrough recognizing my technical ability and attempting to assign me work that suits that ability. He also recognizes my need to be challenged in my work and directs the more challenging assignments when they become available. I would say that his relatioship with other employees is pretty similar. He recognizes the desires and needs of individuals and attempts to find them work that suits those criteria. However, the bottom line is there is work that needs to get done and sometimes compromises have to bemade to accomplish that work."
264,"She provides me with a lot of coaching and encourages development. The job though is very cutthroat sales, so my heart isn`t in it. She respected me by offering me to move in with her. What kind of boss would care enough to give me a place to live?I declied because it did not seem appropriate to live with my boss. I think my relationship with my boss is better than with my other co-workers with the boss because my boss will give me a nice hug and invite me out for drinks after work, while my boss makes Su and Lisa work week-ends and does not invite them out for work."
265,"I am provided with lots of training and given lots of opportunity to take on new tasks to challenge myself, My boss gives me a task or multiple tasks and knows it will be done well and in a timely manor and he also promoted me to a lead role and made me rsponsible for making sure co-works get there tasks done on time and up to quality. My boss trusts me because if i make a mistake i tell him right away and do not hide it and the same with issues i keep him updated on whats going on"
266,"1) My leader provides me with great coaching and development in terms with my work, work attitude, and professionalism. She is a brilliant leader that should be a role model to everyone who works with passion.

2) Yes, my leader behaves that she is showin me respect and a good interpersonal relationship even though she is my boss.

3) My relationship with my leader as compared to my co-workers' relationships with her is the same for all of us. She gives us equal attention and respect but she tends to bondmore with my co-workers whom have the same gender as she was."
267,"My boss cares about me. She understands that I do my job better when I am satisfied. That is why she is interested in providing me with everything I need to perform my duties. I am not quite sure how my boss should show me that she doesn't respect me. I dn't remember such behavior. At the same time, I do believe that my boss respects me and my coworkers. We have really good relationships in our company. Every member of our company can be sure that he/she is valuable for the company and that the boss will elp in case of need."
268,"My leader offers opportunities for me to improve my skills by sending me to conferences and workshops, and inviting me to meetings that might be beneficial in addressing the intricacies of my work. I think that this in itself shows that she has respect fo me, as a colleague and co-leader of our group. I think that our leader shows the same gratitude to all of my co-workers. I've not yet heard a complaint, or felt that one person was singled out over another. She is very good at giving constructive advice n a fairly timely manner and indicating what skills need to be polished or worked on. We work in philanthropy, however, and I also think that this field is very different than most others."
269,"My leader is not particularly helpful when it comes to some situations. When I am having a difficult time with a project and need help, he is often hesitant to provide any. Still, if I need a day off due to a family issue or a doctor's appointment, he almst always approves my time off. My other coworkers seem to have similar problems with my leader in terms of getting constant phone calls to come in to work on our days off. This can be really frustrating when you only have 1 day off every few months. As fr coaching and development, he doesn't really provide any coaching and there is very little room in the company for advancement."
270,"My leader is not very good. He relies heavily on other's experience to mask his own incompetence. I get along with him fine as a person, but don't particularly respect him as a leader. I know that I will usually have to work twice as hard to make sure tha I am not blamed for his misdeeds. He usually interacts the same with both myself and other coworkers. He has only really thanked me personally twice in all of the time that I've been working with him as a leader, and instead expects me to do things aboveand beyond without any additional recognition."
271,"I have a good working relationship with my manager. She definitely respects me and will leave me alone to do my job. She doesn't provide much coaching, but she knows I don't really need it. She shows me that she respects me by leaving me alone and not beig a micromanager. I think my relationship with my leader is much better than her relationship with my coworkers. Before she was my manager, she was in the same role as me at work and we worked together on many projects before she took over as my manager. o her and I have more of a friendly respect relationship as opposed to a working relationship."
272,"My working relationship with my leader is pleasant and friendly. We respect each other. My department is slightly specialized so they coach me to the best of their ability outside of that specialization. My leader shows that he respects me by commending te work I do, and listening to the problems and complaints that I have. They take the things I say into consideration and act on them if appropriate. My other coworkers have a similar relationship with our leader. He is kind and fair, and respectful to allof the other people that I work with. He is sometimes a little too relaxed but that comes at the cost of being so nice to everyone."
273,"My manager does not provide very much leadership or coaching unless asked for. He tends to be fairly hands off and intervenes only when necessary or when I have my review. This makes it difficult to show him that I am doing well with my current tasks becase he is not available to see these advances. If however I have a problem and come to him he will make himself available for these types of questions or concerns and provide me coaching on what to do, or he will do it himself it he feels it is necessary.  enjoy this aspect of our relationship."
274,"We have a decent relationship. It started out rocky but has improved as time has passed. I was rude to her at first, so she was nasty to me. As I began to accept her leadership and treat her better, she has treated me better as well. I've had to learn to ite my tongue and be respectful, even when I disagree with her. Other co-workers have had better relationships with her than I have. She has favorites and work and she does not care to hide this fact. I'm definitely not her favorite but we are a work in pogress"
275,"My relationship with my leader is pretty standard. We have been working together for just over six years now and haven't really had any issues. She provides coaching opportunities when they arise and if she feels I need them. I am quite an autonomous workr and a high performer, so for the most part she pretty much leaves me be to do my thing. She is there for me should I have any problems or need assistance with anything, but other than that, we meet once a month for my monthly reviews. She does ask me todo more sidework than others because she knows I can handle it and will get the job done."
276,"I recently changed jobs and have been at my current position for one month, so I will use my previous manager for this exercise. My previous manager was very focused on my development, and went out of her way to encourage me to take specific training clases. Also, she offered to sponsor me as I worked to obtain an Information Security certification which she already attained. In terms of respect, my previous manager spent a lot of time away from work due to family obligations. Therefore, she was very openand receptive towards me doing the same. I never feared missing work for family or personal engagements. Under my previous manager, I was the only employee who worked for her."
277,Me and my supervisor have a good relationship .He always support me and guide me through his knowledge and I like him very much.He always tells all the perspective and motivate me to do good work.my supervisor have very good relationship with me.he is so ooperative and supporting.he is good by nature and he is supporting to everyone
278,"He may emerge in a group by virtue of his personality characteristics and qualities or by virtue of common consent by group members. In the latter case, the leader derives his power from the group members. He continues in the leadership position at the plasure of group members collectively. Leadership position exists in most group settings irrespective of the size of the group.Leadership is an influential process. The leader is in a position to shape, regulate, control and change the attitudes, behaviour nd performance of his group members. The latter are supposed to comply with the former’s desires and directives and partially suspend their own judgment and discretion. There exists a particular relationship between the leader and his group members whic is characterised by interpersonal and social interaction."
279,I get along well with my manager.  He and I have a professional relationship and respect each other.  My manager allows me a lot of freedom to run my department with little to no interference.  My manager does not check in routinely and has faith in my ablity to manage my workload.  He provides feedback as needed and keeps me informed of performance and other areas.  He thanks me for my work and asks for feedback on his performance.  His leadership style resonates with me and I am able to have similar reltionships with my direct reports.
280,"Working with my leader is easier going than previous leaders. She's patient and shows respect by not talking down to me whenever I have a question. She also shows respect by asking us questions about ourselves because she is interested. She is not just inerested in herself and genuinely wants to know more about others that she works with. Our relationship is the same as other co workers, she is very patient with everyone. That's a good thing because leaders should not have favorites. Her teaching techniqu is thorough and she explains things in a way that everyone can understand."
281,"I have a pretty minimal relationship with my supervisor. He actually works at a different location from me, so we don't see each other super often. Most of our contact is via email, and even that is on an as-needed basis. I really only contact him to ask ermission to take time off and that sort of thing. So, the coaching and development he provides me with is virtually none. He does respect me by giving me time when I need it. I would say my coworkers have a stronger relationship with him just by nature o their jobs, they have to be in contact with him more."
282,"he is very dedicated and friendly , and  feels a good relationship naturally exists, as he provides all times the best coaching and supports us in all terrible situations and helps us to handle in all projects , he empowers others and considers empathy tocreate strong relationship, as he trust me in all situations and gives a clear space when i needed and supports me with all higher official when i have been avoided mistakenly he shows his respect towards me at that time, and behave friendly and as the reationships with other coworkers are somewhat friendly but he helps me and gives more support than other and gives more freedom to work as he believes me"
283,"My leader provides me opportunities for growth and new challenges.  We have regular meetings and have regular talks about the organization and my role in it.  My leader shows respect for me by allowing me to openly ask questions about changes in the firm nd my role in it.  I have also been invited in to discuss what I want to do in the future and what I see my role being.  I think that I have a better relationship with more openness because of this than many coworkers, although there are a few who are jus as direct as I am and share that same relationship."
284,"My leader provides minimal coaching, usually relying on others to ""learn as you go"", which leads to confusion and constantly needing to ask questions when there are new hires. There is little respect shown because the manager hardly interacts with those ""nder"" him. As I am a supervisor, I feel only fellow workers on my level share similar relationships with the manager, and it's not positive. Entry level workers as well as corporate visitors express lots of frustration about how he handles/avoids serious ssues, and supervisors are left to deal with it exclusively."
285,"It really depends on the task I am on. As a team working on projects, I often find myself trap between what I think is right and what my boss think is right. He is the most wonderful human being when we are on the same path and the goal is clear. i have n problem working with him at all. However, when we are on a different track, he often make me want to quit my job because he is impossible to work with. I do believe there is some kind of mutual respect between us, but not much. I have no problem dealing ith my co-workers and we all believe that it mostly our boss falut when thing doesn't go well"
286,"My boss often sends me emails encouraging me or telling me what a good job did on a certain project.  He listens to my concerns and helps me with customers that are difficult or have issues that are beyond me to help.  I am a little bit closer to him thanother workers, but I think that's just because I go the extra mile and often do things to take stress off of him, like make phone calls to customers we all hate instead of making him do it.  He's very supportive and encourages me to ask questions and lear."
287,My leader is very clear and fair when providing criticism or critique.  He is also very clear in his expectations.  The way he treats me is the same as he treats the other employees in our company.  He also tries to put his self in our place to see a sitution from our point of view.  He is good at listening to our concerns and advice.  He also is willing to help if we need assistance.  This leader worked his way up the company so he is good at looking at situations from different perspectives.
288,I have a really good working relationship with my direct manager.  He has an open door policy and is always willing to give guidance and advice.  He allows me to do my work and does not micro manage at all.  The down side is that when you do need help or uidance you definitely have to ask for it.  My relationship with my manager mirrors the relationship I have with my direct reports.  My manager takes a real interest in me and I in turn take a real interest in my direct reports.  He values my input and le's me know that at every opportunity and I do the same with mine.
289,"My work relationship with my leader is amicable. He and I work together regularly, and he respects my thoughts and opinions on work. We share ideas and bounce it back to each others and other co-workers. He is always willing to listen to what his subordintes have to say, which goes a long way towards making the work environment a pleasure to work in. Without his input and trust in the team, i would not think our division would be nearly as effective as it is today. I am sure his leadership style is what mkes us so effective in day-to-day work."
290,"I have an open and frank relationship with my supervisor. We are in constant communication about work tasks, performance, compensation and satisfaction. My supervisor is always asking for my thoughts and opinions on our job tasks and treats me with respec. He values my input and is not afraid to share with others. He will provide appropriate feedback in a respectful manner, and recognize my efforts to his superiors. He cares for my well being and makes sure that I have a good work-life balance. My relatioship with my supervisor is similar to relationships with other coworkers, one of respect and cooperation."
291,"I would say that our relationship is conflicted. He is a very large hypocrite and not very friendly towards my coworkers, but he seems to like me very much. As a result, I don't often stand up for my coworkers or share in their emotions about him. I have lways said that my priority in work is to get ahead first, not make friends. I won't necessarily step on anyone in the process, but I will always do what I need to do to be successful. That being said, I believe he does have his heart in the right place, ut not always at the right moment."
292," I have a good relation with my leader, he cares me and I get good feedback from him.we all are a team and there is no superiority complex among us.I like to work here because this is an amazing placer.We feel like we are a team and so we have common respnsibilities. We won't criticize each other. But will advice if one of us makes a mistake.We will teach patiently about it and so the other one is not desperate. I think that is a good way to be followed in an organization.I ilke to work with my leader."
293,My leader is a micro manager. He wants to be involved in most tasks that are performed in his group. While he does value contributions with verbal thanks on some occasions it usually is not reflected in yearly reviews. At first I thought it was my performnce that he did not like but I asked others in the group and I was told that he is the same way with all of my peers. It is very frustrating to work so hard and not be rewarded for your work. I think it is time to look for another position.
294,I don't recieve any coaching or guidance from my manager but I certainly would like to. My manager respects me somewhat. I guess she could be worse. I don't appreciate last minute schedule changes. That's very disrespectful to me. Some of my co workers ar closer in a business sense to my manager than me. They've been working there longer. And they are just more extroverted as well. But I don't know how well their relationship is with our boss so you would have to ask them individually because it's none ofmy business and I stick to myself at
295,My leader provides me a proper and clear vision about the organizations goals and its expectations from me. Also he guides me the steps required on day to day or weekly basis so that each day I am moving towards my goals and proving my worth to the organiation. If any mistake committed on my part then instead of torturing I get a clear coaching of what my mistake is and in future how I can avoid it.
296,I would say that I have a somewhat unusual relationship with my manager in the fact that I trained him for his job. His predecessor (my last manager) had left and I was filling in until they could replace her. During that time I learned her job as well asfinished learning the ropes of my own job given the fact that I was only with the company for five months when the last manager left. Therefore I actually ended up training Bryan when he came in. He depends upon and trusts me a great deal in our relationsip and our working together is really more about a collaboration than would be typical.
297,"My manager doesn't provide me with a large amount of coaching and development. However, that is fine with me because I don't want somebody annoying me anyway. I dont think I need somebody hovering over me to provide guidance, even when it's not jrcrssary.y leader shows that he respects me by being considerate and respectful when dealing with me. Our communications and interactions have always been civil and respectful. I would say that my co-workers and I have the same type of relationship with our supervsor. He doesn't appear to choose favorites, and we all seem to be on the same level."
298,"Although my manager accept me as a good worker, he still can't be a dependable leader.  He sometimes, desert the workers in between in times of adversities.  He can't be counted on times of emergency.  Sometimes he is not accessible too.  When we have som important family matters to deal with and leave is a necessity, he just ignore all the good works that we did in the past and just harass us for asking for a leave.  That behavior always irritated me a lot.  I just couldn't get along with it.  Secondly h is just focusing on goals only, but never bothered about the  ways by which we can attain the goal."
299,"My relationship with my leader at work is particularly professional but we enjoy our impersonal relation also in some other setting. My leader is ideal for me because he has trained me from the basic. He always have a sense of humor at highest. Not, only e he favors all the staffs also motivates for work quality. He is ideal for every employee, he gives emphasis on enhancement of personal skill. One in another way, he's been perfect leader, motivator, persuader, he is the central figure on which everythin revolves around. Frankly, speaking I am close to our leader in many impersonal settings precisely outside the office premises."
300,My leader is very good at his job and encourages all of us to do the best we can. Our leader respects everyone at our work and is very vocal about coaching us to be the best workers we can be. My relationship with the boss is the same as all the other worers. Our leader cares for us all equally and is willing to do whatever it takes to help us succeed. He is willing to help any of us out with anything we need withing reason. Its great to have such a strong willed person leading us and letting us know we cn accomplish anything.
301,"My leader is a former mid-level military officer.  He has not made a noticeable transition from his military days to his new role in managing civilians.  He rules with a slightly weakened iron fist.  He expects full attention and allegiance, doesn't accep the opinions or suggestions of subordinates, is not friendly, can be rude and unforgiving, but runs a productive division within the company. He treats all of his subordinates equally and I suspect that most of my co-workers would share my opinions fairl closely.  There is little if any positive feedback.  The reward in doing the job is to be found in knowing that one's responsibilities to the company and to the customers are being fulfilled at a high level."
302,My relationship with my manager is very open. She is future oriented and anticipates changes. She is also open to my feedback as she knows that I can tell what works and what doesn't because I work with the company software on a daily basis. This working elationship has headed off potential project failures because I am able to see the limits of the software in relationship to what my manager is trying to do so that she can implement upgrades and procedure changes. My manager recognizes each of our strenghs and weaknesses and works with us on an individual basis. She does not try to get us to compete against each other.
303,"My relationship with my ""leader"" -- the HR representative who is over secretaries -- is rather good.  I'm viewed in sort of two ways by HR:  (1) a very valuable asset who is extremely capable and agreeable - in short, someone who is willing to help whenevr needed and who can do almost any task given, whether secretarial, IT, or web design; and (2) someone who they don't really like because I'm very smart and they have the notion that I am a bit superior, which I really try to not convey.  They are always ery, very polite and sometimes friendly.  One slight way in which they could show respect more is that when asking a large favor -- to cover someone extra for, say, 3 months, they could be courteous enough to walk down the hall (100 feet) and give the assgnment in person.  Obviously, phone is fine for small requests.  

My relationship as opposed to co-workers?  I can't say.  I think they are generally fair and polite to everyone.  Perhaps they have personality favorites -- I do not know.

We get training but only as needed to do our work."
304,"I really receive no coaching at all. My supervisor takes a very hands off approach. I think that I only get talked to if I do poorly or if I screw up. I think he may or may not respect me. He really only speaks to me when something goes wrong or when ther is new information that he has to give me. I do quite well at my company and I am glad that I do because other people constantly have to talk to him and get talked down to by him. People who do not perform as well as I do are constantly being forced to iteract with him. I am excused from many meetings and conference calls that others are forced to attend/be on. From what I hear, these meetings and calls are less about managing or coaching and more about complaining and demanding better results"
305,I have e been in my position for 9 years so I do not need coaching or development. My leader stays in his office. Some of the new people don't even know who he is. Ver anti social. It's always their way or the highway without a solid explanation. Relationhips with co workers far outweigh in a positive way than relationships with managers.
306,"The relationship is cordial and professional, but definitely one-sided. My manager cares about my job satisfaction only to the extent that it affects results and thereby, his performance. He does offer advice, but generally that advice has less to do withme and more about how to get around obstacles, and often the recommended approach is acquiescence by me. I wouldn't call that coaching. In terms of respect, he does make himself available and is quite a good listener. Generally, I would say that I am treaed on par with my peers, that is to say, my manager's behaviors are no better or worse toward me than toward others."
307,My leader provides appropriate and necessary training.
308,"Our leader provides very good coaching and gives practical training , He treats politely and greets well. He responds immediately to all my issues and considers my requests a lot. He is always humble and loyal to me. This was a pretty stupid thing for me o say, but I still think my point was right. In some organizations, almost anyone can get promoted to management if they put in the time and play the right politics. Instead of trying to become a mere manager, therefore, why not aspire to become a great lader?"
309,My leader is often in the background at my job but always make an effort to interact with me each week and praise me for doing things.  He always is available by email or phone and always makes an effort to ask how I am doing and how we can improve the enironment that we work in.  It is a really positive relationship because he will bounce ideas off of me and I can do the same with him.  We have  a great working relationship where he really lets me do what I want as long as I get the job done correctly an efficiently.
310,"My immediate boss is a genius ! he can read people's mentalities at a glance.He is an easy going person at the same knows how to extract work from the team without being a taunt.His behaviour towards the team is like any family member who embraces calmnes and dictates what he wants like an elder brother ! He shows respect towards each of us without being very bossy like any other boss ! His leadership qualities make him a lovable person and the team is willing to serve under him in any dire consequences fr ex : we had this release in a short period but unfortunately had booked a vacation for a week.But my conscience dint allow me to go on a vacation when my services were needed,Hence I had to cancel my vacation."
311,"he is giving small amount of coaching to me about the new works assigned to me. But I will gather information from all other sources and will finish the work very correctly. That's why my manager like me and consider to assign new works for me. He respectme by way of hearing words whenever I called him. He respect me more than compare to others. If myself and my co-worker asked any questions, he will reply to me first because of my activities. I also respect him by way of straight talk without any hidden ole. So, he likes me very much compare to other."
312,"My leader doesn't really provide me with coaching or development.  To be honest, I don't see a whole lot of him.  He behaves fine when I do see him; he's kind and respectful, but sometimes I wonder if he knows where the organization is going.  My relationhip with him is similar to that of many of my colleagues, with the exception of a few male colleagues who are more highly regarded and valued than everyone else.  I am not entirely sure why this dynamic exists, but it's been that way as long as I've been ere."
313,"I have a great leader, and also a great supervisor.  My leader offered me the job without me even looking for it, and has steadily increased my responsibilities during my time there.  The thing that I appreciate the most is that he sees my potential bette than I do; he regularly gives me projects and tasks that I think are too difficult for me, but I manage to do them, and that makes me proud and happy.  He believes in me more than I do.  He often compliments me when I am alone, and also in meetings.  My o-workers have good relationships with him as well, but some of them are afraid of him, and do not speak up as much as I do.  For example, if he gives us a project and it is taking longer than we thought, he is confident that I will be the one to approachhim before we get in a bind and will notify him that the scope was too big for the time allotted."
314,"My leader provides coaching and development informally, usually by providing suggestions of different ways to handle work and connect with people across the company. He shows respect by listening closely and looking at the details of work product. He'll aso provide information about leadership meetings to give a view of how things are changing within the company and give a greater understanding of the business. He has acted as an advocate within the organization, finding opportunities for projects that wil strengthen my skills. He also perfectly understands the problems within the company culture and is willing to acknowledge them; giving a realistic picture of how initiatives will unfold. Elements of these traits are common in the company culture, but hi transparent style takes these things to a different level."
315,"We are very independent of one another. I consult him when I have an issue or need a larger idea or approval but he he leaves me alone to do my job on a day to day basis. Because I work in a specialized area that he does not know much about, he leaves me lone and lets me work on my own. ITs a good relationship that has taken some time to establish and iron out.. At first it was much more tense but things have evolved. Its different then others in my position because I seem to be trusted more."
316,"I have a give and take relationship with my leader. It is always a win-win situation between us. She provides me with enough learning and gives me opportunity to develop my personal and career growth by allowing me to attend trainings related to my work. he respects my decision all the time and allows me to be independent in terms of finding solution to my problems at work. She always acknowledge my contributions to our organization and I feel well about how she treated me everyday. Sometimes when we havesome work challenges she constantly reminds me that I can always count on her and she got my back. She has become a good friend, boss, and a colleague to me at the same time. I can say I am very lucky to have my job where I am happy working with my colleaues and manager everyday."
317,"i have received not enough to coaching, my leader is the best knowledgeable person he is provide all types of coaching, he respects very much but doesn't show all time. my relationship with leader is very very respectful, he also treat me very respectful n all manner. i didn't hesitate to discuss about the matter with leader at any time. My relationship with my co-worker's are very friendliness, jolly and enjoyable. we are discussing all matter without any worries, hesitation, etc., we are sharing our ides about to solve the problem in work also and don't share with any other person."
318,My leader and I have a good relationship. He is very smart and can guide me quite easily. He teaches me all the things I need to know. I am not afraid to ask a question because of the way he is. He respects me by listening to my ideas. I am not always rigt but he still listens. That is saying a lot. I think my relationship is better than most of my other co workers. Compared to my coworkers I am at the top of the friendship chart. I feel like this is a good thing to be.
319,"Well my leader very much friendly, He helps me through any issue regarding office work and set a path for me to grow in the organisation. He is a good person in many perspective even he gets angry he speaks politely, Even if i did not achieved the target e doesn't show any anger. There are number of other workers but i have a good connection with my leader as compare to others, Because there are certain matching thoughts that we have in common. That might be the reason that he give a little respect to me s compared to others."
320,My leader is great at making sure that if I need help he will help me and if I did something wrong he will tell me. He always makes sure to listen to what I have to say and try's to help me out when he can. I feel like I can go to my leader and ask for soething and be able to talk to him when I need something compared to some of my other coworkers. I know that he is there to help when needed at has my best interests in mind. I know that he will let me know when I need to do something differently and help e to get it done right.
321,I would say overall my relationship is really good with my manager. They allow me to have a lot of independence in how I manage my team. Due to that though I would say my manager does not overly coach or develop me. If I do ever need something from them o need a favor or their help in pushing something through they have always been there for me. I would say overall I am one of the more favored people though of my manager. I do not think others have the same ability to request his help when needed that I d.
322,"My manager provides me training about new updated technologies. He appreciates when I perform good. He values when I put hardwork. He understands my personal problems as well. Sometimes  I have to go home early when my kids are not well. He shows respect owards my personal problem. Whenever decisions need to be taken, he takes our opinion too. Sometimes he has to show strictness but overall he is a good manager. He treats everyone equally. Anyone who is performing good, is appreciated in front of others s others are motivated too to work hard. My co workers too shows respect for my manager because he deserves it."
323,Very very hard and truthful training to me.its will give effort to me.very respective .co workers gives good response to me .Very very hard and truthful training to me.its will give effort to me.very respective .co workers gives good response to me Very vry hard and truthful training to me.its will give effort to me.very respective .co workers gives good response to me Very very hard and truthful training to me.its will give effort to me.very respective .co workers gives good response to me Very very hardand truthful training to me.its will give effort to me.very respective .co workers gives good response to me
324,"I would say it was a good relationship. My boss provides lots of coaching and development. He wants us to do a good job and get it done right the first time. However, he does not hold my hand through the process. He provides guidance and lets me work my wy through it. In this way, it shows respect for my abilities, and does not treat me in an inferior way.  He treats the co-workers in my department the same way. They get some guidance from him, but need to have the ability to work through it themselves."
325,"My relationship with my leader is solid, with mutual respect. My leader dedicates a lot of time to training me and making sure that my work is up to par, while at the same time being kind and attentive when I need it. There is more of a parental aspect wih my manager than with my co-workers, which is understandable, and has undoubtedly contributed to my efforts at work and willingness to go out of my way for her. My manager often brings in snacks for us to eat and takes part in dinners and Christmas gift xchanges as well in order to demonstrate the relationship outside of the workplace."
326,I would describe our relationship as very positive and professional. My leader provides minimum coaching which to me is a positive but he is always there if something out of the ordinary pops up that I don't have an answer for or at the very least need toget a secondary opinion. My leader show's that he respects me just in the way he talk's to me and listens to my opinion's. I like to think my manager treats other co workers in the same manner as he does myself which is pleasantly and professionally. I neer feel like there are any favoritism going on in the work place.
327,My leader gives me advice on what kind of training I would require for promotion and further improvement in my career. He gives me opportunities at company presentations which would enhance my growth and I am able to meet senior representatives of my compny. I am able to present my capabilities and skills in front of the senior management with the help of my leader. 
328,"1) She does not offer much coaching in terms of specifics, but offers insight through her own experiences. She allows me to figure out the technicalities, while she offers a overarching goal for me
2) She shows a high level of respect for any employee. Raely you would find her bad mouthing or disrespecting someone in the organization.
3) I think my relationship with my leader is a little bit more valued than others because of the work I put in. I offer her value and thus we have a better relations than mot co-workers. I take pride in working for her."
329,"My leader has a great working relationship with both me and my co-workers. She is always open to suggestions, and very receptive of new ideas. She also puts effort into remembering little things about each of us; such as I like coffee, a co-worker that loes scarves, and another co-worker that enjoys fishing. She uses this knowledge to incorporate personalization into conversations and gifts. She is always professional, yet relatable when having conversations with us and makes sure to ask for input. She neer intrudes on personal matters, but does make a point to remember spouses names and ask about them. She has asked me to sit in on important meetings so that I am kept up-to-date on organizational happenings and she encourages me to attend seminars and buiness events that are relevant to our organization."
330,My leader threw me into this job. I didn't know how to do it but I learned quickly. With that being said I am the best one for the job. We have always gotten along because we are identical. We both care about the company and we both care about each othersjob. We have been close for over 6 years and know that we have each others back. We know each others job so if any thing should happen either one of us can take over. When one of us is having a bad day we either cheer each other up or stay away from each ther.
331,I see that working relationship with my manager is going great as he helps me out to learn out new things and suggest me the areas that i need to improve and area that i need to focus on. I do feel my manager has showing me a great respect as he used to hve a meeting with me consistently once in every 15 days asking for my concerns and how things going on. If i have any concerns he listens to it and take appropriate actions to get it solved. my relationship with my manager is great as he has a good manageial skills treats me with the respect.
332,When it comes to our relationship its a great one. Its more one of guidance. He is there to make sure I remain on the path that we sat down and set for myself. At any point in time I can go to them with questions dealing with work and other wise. I think hat they have made it clear that their office is always open no matter what. If we succeed then it means they do as well. We are  a part of a team and thus we need to make sure that we make things better for one another.
333,"My leader likes to take credit for all the work done in the building. When we do great, it is because of his leadership. Only a small portion of our success, according to him, is because of what we do. My leader does not show much respect for his employee. Often he is rude and ignores us. It is obvious that he has a certain few in the building that he likes more. The rest of us are practically ignored, even when telling him good morning. He usually just looks as us, walks on, and does not give a response."
334,"I work as a civilian for the Air Force, my supervisor is a great manager and leader. He ensures the people in his department are aware of all dealing in our division, is big on people being recognized for their work and allows his people to do the their jbs.
 He always asked how you are doing and will come to you for advice on things dealing with you expertise. He holds a high regard for his people's experience and supports us completely, and defends us if necessary.  He treats everyone the same in the diision as a leader should."
335,"I would describe my working relationship with my leader as a cordial one. My leader is concerned about production, efficiency, cutting waste numbers, and looking good in the eyes of their own supervisors. My leader does not coach me, other than barking ou general guidelines for current production. I feel that my leader only utilizes me to make themselves look better, and has no interest in me excelling beyond my current position. My leader shows that they respect me by allowing me to stay in my current poition and work. I have a very bland, and baseline relationship with my supervisor. My co-workers' relationships with my supervisor is a little more pleasant and colorful than my relationship with my supervisor."
336,There is lot of support in terms of training and development  is provided by my leader and my company also empower him to take certain decision for the benefit of employee experience. They always cares and respect the the decision taken by me and if they isagree then they specify completely what is the reason behind that. My manager always show a steady behavior with me and my colleague. He provides equal opportunity to all the coworker but look forward to support people who go beyond the expectation in trms of hardwork and smartwork shown by people. Indeed very supportive.
337,"I have been with the company for awhile and have seen many come and go. I am also well acquainted with colleagues in other states as I have done traveling for training sessions several times. My leader is confident in my ability and trust my instincts. Sh does not need to guide me at all, and we communicate well with one another."
338,My leader provides no coaching and development.  There is no opportunity for training and she doesn't want to spend the money.  She doesn't really know anything about my job so she can't provide any sort of help to me at all.  She doesn't show respect at ll but I'm fairly thick skinned about it.  My co-workers absolutely can't stand her.  Every time one of them leaves they file a complaint about her.  She knows more about their jobs so she interferes and micro-manages to a maximum extent.  In that respectit's an advantage for me because she doesn't know anything about my job she can only yell at me if something bad happens.
339,"I have worked with my manager for about 9 years now. When I first started he micro managed every little tasked that I needed to do and would always be telling me what to do and to document what I was doing. Now that we have known each other for so long, Iam allowed to pretty much do whatever it is that I want to do as long as it is for the benefit of the company. I meet with him from time to time to let him know what I've been up to, but other than that, all of our communication is friendly chat."
340,My manager provides me coaching and feedback on a monthly basis.  My manager shows me a great amount of respect on a professional and personal level.  My manager shows the same amount of respect to everyone on our team.  She is interested in my professionl success as well as my personal success.  We spend time together outside of work at holiday parties and team outings.  She is very transparent and easy to get along with.  She as been my direct leader for over 6 years and I am very happy with out relatioship.  I am glad to have her as a supervisor.
341,"My manager canntot really provide coaching and development in my field of work and he knows that, because I am better than him in this aspect. So, being unable to do something on this field he tries to teach me things in other fields, like managing peopleand handling situations as a leader, and I am really thankful for it. So, with all that i get respect from him, but also he frequently tells me that he resoects me for who I am and what I know. That I am unique. The problem is that I believe that he does hat to all my co-workers,so I am not sure hiw meaningful and sincere that is."
342,"Working with my boss/leader is challenging most days. She's an extreme micro manager and consistently doesn't believe that I am capable of doing my job, though I've never given her provocation to believe elsewise. I don't find her relatable, nor friendly.She challenges me on every suggestion I make to management. I feel absolutely no respect from her and feel more like i'm treated like a child. I have better relationships with my other co-workers and others have said she is difficult to work for and/or wok in a group with. My leader has been admonished numerous times by her boss. I would like to have any other boss but her."
343,"My leader strives to provide great results for our customers. In my position, there is not much coaching required. My leader is always courteous in conversation and when asking me to take on a task. I think that my relationship is at about the same level s others that work with me, although at times I feel as though I have move flexibility to do my job as I see fit due to seniority and experience. All in all, my leader is very easy to get along with and they are always willing to assist me in any way possble."
344,"My leader provides needed equipment and information to do my job well. When something is needed, he goes out of his way to provide it with out questioning me. He treats me the way he wants to be treated, with respect. If I need to leave early or have an eergency, he undersands 100%. I go above and beyond and he shows that he knows that I do so. He treats all of his employees this way, I am no different than the rest. We dont overstep boundaries in the work place, work is work and home is home."
345,My leader gives me an efficient and nice coaching on any subject related to work. He is willing to coach at any time if i ask him any doubts. My leader cares for me helps me in my work if i get into trouble and thus shows great respect for me. He also motvates me greatly if i finish my work quickly and also encourages me to my work without any pressure and mistakes. My relationship with my leader is very good and i like him so much and his care is very essential for the better achievement of my goals.
346,"I have a good relationship with my leader at work. I have worked with him a long time, I knew him quite a bit before he got promoted. I have worked at my current position for a long time now, and I am very competent in how I do my job. As such, my leader eans on me when he needs someone to do something and know that they won't screw it up. I like him on a personal level also, he is fun to talk with. I would say overall that I have a very good relationship with my leader at work."
347,"My leader provides me with a lot of coaching and development, and he really tries to understand what I need from him. He goes above and beyond to assign me tasks that he knows I will enjoy, and that use my education and skill set in the analytics field. Ithink that all of my coworkers have a good relationship with our manager because he is always willing to talk to people and hear what they are doing well with and what they are struggling with so that he can do anything he can to help us in that situation"
348,"I have been very lucky to have had terrific managers during my career so far. I have respected each of them, and got along well with all of them. She knows how to motivate people in our team. She is approachable and gives a good advice when need. I have fund that if I take the time to talk with my manager at the beginning of a project, we can all get off to a great start on the same page. She resolve conflict quickly and efficiently. She show that she cares about the employees and thus give a very good atosphere in the office."
349,My leader is a an excellent coach and cheerleader for my efforts. She is supportive and give compliments to show she appreciates my work. She has this same relationship with all members. She is great at helping my find resources to guide the next step in y career. She cares about the process rather than being extremely results oriented at all costs.
350,My relationship with the leader is the same as anyone elses. He treats us all with respect and is there in order to help us achieve team goals as well as the individual goals we have set for ourselves in order to be the best we can be. I think that that teir ability to be there and help us out when it comes to us needing some guidance and assistance he is always able to use his experience and expertise in order to find the best solution for us that the issue that we are facing. They make sure that we haveall we need to get things done.
351,"After years of having the same supervisor and working in close contact throughout the day, each day, every day for the last 12 years - we have developed an understanding that does not require ant words between each other, I understand my job, my leader knws I understand my job.  I rarely ever have to ask for guidance but if I did I know that she is there for me. I never feel funny or awkward having to ask for guidance if need be, we have developed a complete working relations during hours and a nice tende relationship after hours."
352,I describe my relation with my leader as a strong one. He always give us the opportunity to learn new technology and provide us knowledge of whats new going on outside the company. He always have a smile talking with me in front of other colleagues and inroduces me with the new manager whenever they come to visit us. My leader have a good nature and he treats all the colleagues in the team as equal. He don't show any in balance with in the team. He always gives us the oppurtunity to learn new thing and alays praises us for the job well done.
353,"We work at a restaurant, and it seems like he's happier to stick with what we've been doing (some menu items have been running for over a decade) than try something new. Part of me feels like he's a creature of habit to the point of detriment or something It's not a destructive trait BUT it also doesn't move us 'forward' in any way. Another part of me feels like he just hasn't found his voice yet. If so it's something we can relate on, and a productive conversation could come of it. If not, then the sous hef and I could probably come up with some great things."
354,"I have a great relationship with my boss. She's possibly the best supervisor I've ever had - very collegial, very respectful, and appreciative of our value and skills. She is not big on demonstrations of authority or hierarchy, instead she really works asa team member with her team. She does provide direction and a sense of mission, but she really works with us, and never acts in an authoritarian way. About being respectful: she always listens to what we have to say, clearly values our input and lets us tke ownership of our projects. And she never acts like she matters more than us in the great scheme of things. As far as I can see, she acts the same way with all her subordinates - I don't feel like I have a ""special"" relationship with her, she simply is hat way with everybody. When it comes to coaching and development though, there is not much of that going on, probably because of time constraints."
355,"My manager more or less treats me like an equal. She has been a great mentor and helped me to grow my skills a great deal since I have worked for the company. I sometimes think she struggles with delegating and with finishing tasks because she takes on th bulk of the workload, so I try to help her out whenever I can, and I know she appreciates it. When I am feeling overwhelmed, she steps up and takes something off my plate for me. We are also friends outside of work. Overall, I think she is a great leader"
356,"We have weekly staff meetings that are lead by my manager. She uses that time to give the over-all big picture, but also will speak with us individually about tasks and goals. She's also willing to give one-on-one time to focus on my future goals within te organization. I believe the best way my manager shows her respect is to be hands-off. She's not constantly hovering over us to check our work or see what we are doing. I connect more with my manager on a professional level whereas I have coworkers who cnnect with her additionally on a personal level."
357,"I mostly have negative opinion with my partner. I sometimes get upset with him. in case of any problems , I have tom face him terribly. I have worst experience compared to my other workers relationship. So my relationship is not that much secure. Passive ggressiveness is a strategy used when a person basically isn’t able to confront issues directly so instead will use indirect means of criticizing you. It could be in the form of comments or actions that make you question yourself or cause you to make mitakes."
358,"My relationship with my leader is a give and take and is better than most of my fellow co workers. My leader gives me more space and relies on my skills and commitment to take care of my responsibilities without having to be a helicopter leader. My leaderhas not shown me much coaching beyond my initial training period. However, there are some times when the leader goes out of the way to demonstrate a new selling or promoting technique to me as well as other employees. But for the most part my leader has ahands off approach as looking no as the leader is kept in the loop financially."
359,My leader is typically there for me and willing to help develop me professionally by providing on site training and development activities throughout the year. She shows that she respects me by understanding if projects do not go correctly as planned and s willing to work with me to figure out better solutions to problems. She allows me to do things my way and lets me work independently without always feeling the need to be over my shoulder. My relationship with my leader is about the same as my coworkersrelationship with the leader. There is not much variation in one individual having a much better relationship than another.
360,"I'm the equivalent of Milton in the movie Office Space. I had my own office at one point, now I'm in a cubicle on the other side of the building next to the filing cabinets in a corner all by myself. Everyone forgets that I even work here because I'm thatfar away from the rest of my coworkers. I'm not included in the department updates, nor the memos, they have meetings without me, etc. My boss gets along with everyone but he is not as friendly with me."
361,"We have a good relationship - my manager is less technical than I am in the field we work in, so a lot of our working relationship is less technically-minded, which is a bit frustrating for me - so the coaching aspect of our relationship is less about theactual work I'm doing and more about managing the soft skills of the position. My manager definitely respects me and frequently tells me and others that my contributions are great for the company. Among other coworkers, everybody respects and enjoys beingunder the leadership of our manager - they do good work."
362,"My leader routinely coaches me on the softer skills that are required for advancement. He has much faith in my technical skills and abilities to do the job, but he works frequently with me on building out the larger skills required to have long-term succes in business. 

He treats me with a friendly demeanor, although not afraid to correct incorrect work or actions firmly. It is honestly a wonderful relationship and I feel he treats my colleagues similarly. 

As a whole, I can say that he has my interestsat heart, while also working to advance the organization and I cannot ask much more than that."
363,"When I joined the company I was new to the corporate culture. I was even naive about my dressing sense. My supervisor too time to explain me on how to present myself. I was so straight forward and too honest to be compatible with colleagues. He asked me t stop teaching others about morality. He wanted me succeed in life and in my job rather than fighting and teaching others. He asked me to be a role model to others.

After few years, whenever there arises a crisis, he tell everyone to learn from me. 

Thogh he does the same for others too, only few people learnt from him. I am proud to say I am one among them."
364,"My leader and I have a good working relationship. We have semi-formal join-ups every quarter (three months) to discuss more work plan as well as my career goals. He also provides me with an assessment of my potential within the company. Outside of these jin-ups, we have informal conversations nearly almost every day. We both work near each other so we see each other every day. I enjoy working with someone in person vice remotely. My leader provides very similar feedback and behavior to my other co-workers Overall he is a good leader that understands his people and enjoys working with others."
365,"My leader does not provide much coaching or development.  We have mostly the same work tasks and demands.  He just so happens to have been with the organization longer than I have, so he has seniority over me.  We do mostly the same.  There is no need forhim to coach me much, and I'm expected to coach myself, and learn any aspects of the work myself.  He certainly respects me, but he doesn't really show it.  We have a pretty mutual empathetic relationship for each other.  We work alongside of each other t complete the same objectives, and we cooperate and try to stay out of each other's way."
366,"My working relationship with my supervisor is nearly perfect. If I make any mistakes, which I rarely do, I can expect fair and concise coaching on the subject. My leader shows that he respects me on a daily basis by asking for my ideas and input on work rlated manners. I believe that my coworkers also have a very appropriate, warm and friendly relationship with my supervisor. I believe that he is fair and understanding and everyone that appreciates that does benefit from his experience and interactions. I people have a good work ethic they have no trouble getting along with him."
367,"Last year my leader at work was also the one who formally evaluated me so I got to know her pretty well. For the evaluation we had to spend hours together talking about my performance on a really long rubric they must use. I have received a lot of positiv feedback, but also had areas identified that I needed help and future training on. My leader shows that she respects me by listening to what I have to say and praising the good things I'm already doing. I believe my coworkers have had the same experience with this person because she is equitable to all workers."

369,"I would say that my personal working relationship with my supervisor is better than that with a lot of my other coworkers. He knows that of all the other people here he can count on me to not screw him over in terms of simple things like meeting deadlinesor not being late without good cause. We have a good relationship that also includes a fair amount of humor. I would say that we genuinely like each other, which makes it more fun and easy to work here even or especially during the busiest seasonal times.I think that I would spend effort to maintain this status."
370,I have a good relationship with my supervisor.  She does not really need to coach or develop my technical skills but she does coach me on how to handle policies and regulations set by the company.  I really believe that she values my work and respects my ffort and knowledge of the industry.  She seems to have a good relationship with other employees but she does seem to rely on me more than she does on others.  She appreciates the fact that I need little guidance and I am always helping others.  When she s not there she usually puts me in charge.
371,"Almost for any work my leader believe me to a extent that he simply asks me to carry out the job. Whenever he has doubt in his work without any hesitation or ego he asks me to clarify it. We have a mutual understanding that we both work for the best and w respect each other. The co-workers also have a cordial relationship with me and with the leader. We work as a team to achieve the good ideals of the department. Moreover everyone in the team is more caring, flexible and friendly to work with. Great team ork together!!"
372,"I have a difficult working relationship with my leader. It is very inconsistent and I never know how she will react to a particular situation on any given day. Somedays it may be a positive reaction but sometimes there is a negative reaction to the same stuation. I receive an equal amount of coaching and development as most other staff although there are a few who are shown more respect in situations. I have learned that if I approach at the right time and in the right way, I will have better, more positie reactions. It's also better to ask for development as it's more likely to happen if it's asked for than if you wait for it to be offered."
373,"My working relationship with my supervisor is mediocre at best. He is not what I would call a ""leader"". He is very relaxed and laid back, which is fine, but not all the time. He is quite a bit younger than me and he just does not see the big picture. He des not reprimand and document other employees who should have been terminated years ago. I have a much better relationship with my colleagues and subordinates. I believe my supervisor needs more training and should take appropriate classes on how to be aneffective and efficient leader for our team."
374,"My working relationship with my leader is highly respectful.  He is very intelligent, communicates well, and considers my input.  He is respectful to everyone and encourages good collaboration among all workers.  He is good about spelling out specific expctations, providing needed information to complete tasks and projects and providing enough space and independence and trust of others to get the job done.  He is professional and expects professionalism of everyone.  He is a great role model, he illustrats an excellent eye for details, reliability and accountability, and is very well-organized.  He has been in his profession for more than 30 years and has a strong history with the organization.  He is an excellent resource."
375,"My leader works very closely with me. Because I am on the tail end of being new, he provides a lot of guidance and feedback on the work that I do. He is always respectful of how he presents that feedback and always takes into account how much effort I putinto the product that he is reviewing. He is efficient at what he does, does not drag his feet on any request, and is always willing to take some time to help out. He does this for all coworkers who ask for it--because some coworkers have been here for qute a bit of time, they don't need as much guidance as I do, but will seek it out from him. He is always happy to help."
376,"What I like about my manager, Paula, is that whenever she tells us that she needs some of us to volunteer for an assignment, she also is the first one to volunteer.  I really respect her for that.  A lot of managers feel that they are above it all and onl want the workers to do the extra work.  Not Paula, she is always at the head of the line and I find that inspiring.  She is the kind of supervisor that I would want to be.  I consider myself lucky to have her as my boss."
377,"My relationship with my boss is pretty good in comparison with my coworkers. We seem to have a pretty friendly relationship. However, in general with all of us, he does not provide us with enough direction and expects us to know where to head next. There re some occasions where he makes suggestions, but a lot of the time he just waits for you to present what you have done and offers his critiques and comments for things to improve. Basically he wants us to develop to a point where we know what he wants wihout being told in advance."
378,"My manager does not provide a whole lot of coaching or development opportunities, but rather relies on us to further ourselves professionally. This is the same for all employees except for maybe a few who are new to the company. I generally feel respectedas there is general interest in my personal life, politeness in our work environment, and there is a lot of trust placed on me such as being left alone in the store with valuable merchandise for days at a time. Not all employees have a chummy relationshipwith the boss, and some even go out of their way to avoid interacting with management."
379,"My leader has trained me from my initial hiring, and provides updates on my progress and performance regularly. He meets with me at least twice a month and visits with me daily. He also responds to my emails and questions in a timely manner, and helps me ith any problems I have. He gets people to help when my computer isn't working and I can't do aspects of my job, and isn't frustrated with me when this happens but understands it's out of my control. Other coworkers have similar relationships with him. Ou whole team likes our manager because he is a good leader."
380,My leader is awesome.  He always listens to my issues and advises me.  I respect him because he has worked here longer than I have and has been involved in so many different areas of the company.  He seems to think things through with a clear head and notget too angry.  I can tell him anything and I know he will have my back.  He keeps things light with our team and he is very flexible.  I think he gives me a little more respect than the others on the team b/c I am most senior.
381,"My working relationship with my Leader is like the relationship between dog and cat. Sometimes, he behave like a Mentor and sometimes, he behave like he doesn't know me very well. As the concern regarding coaching and development, he did it well. He helpsme to improve my performance level a lot. Professionally, he behaves well in office , specially in front of my co-workers. But, when he meet me individually he treats me differently. My fellow co-workers relationship with my leader is same like me, I notied no such difference. But, yes few senior workers are there who have some different kind of understanding level."
382,"My leader is a total jackass and that is putting it mildly in a very polite way. He does not provide coaching or proper leadership to any of the workers. He shows very little respect towards the workers. He has workers that he considers his favorites, andeven with them he still happens to speak badly about them behind their back. Basically he is a two faced hypocrite that speaks badly about many workers and even other people in leadership positions. Many people are afraid of him because they do not want t be on his bad side because they know that he will be vengeful and purposefully retaliate in a bad way."
383,"My manager and I have a fairly good working relationship. His approach is rather hands off. He trusts and expects his employees to do their jobs and handle the day to day tasks of their jobs with having him have to babysit them. This is ok most of the tim but there are times when specific directions, guidance, and feedback would be helpful and appreciated. All in all it is a good working relationship, though it did take me some getting used to his management style. I can not really complain because I haveworked for far worse supervisors in the past."
384,"My supervisor is a very aloof individual working on the other side of the building from me.  He often does not give clear instructions and leaves me to find and manage my own work.  Our relationship has deteriorated since he brought on a new part time worer who works closely with him as an assistant.  He provides me with little coaching though he has given me tips on how to be a better supervisor since I stepped into a more managerial role.  My coworkers, who are all subordinate to me in the office, have ess close relationships with him."
385,"My team leader was a good combination of professionalism and the personal touch. Having risen from the entry-level of an employee, she knew most of the problems that employees faced. She was a good leader and had strong communication skills. She motivatedme to come up with new ideas and always provided helpful feedback. She always set, changed, evaluated and monitored our work goals to improve our bottom line and I learned a lot from him. Building and maintain good working relationships will not only makeyou more engaged and committed to your organization; it can also open doors to key projects, career advancement, and raises."
386,My leader gives me every opportunity to succeed.  They allow me to work on my own schedule and on projects of my choosing.  My leader shows appreciation verbally both individually and in a group.   My leader is this way with all of our employees.   My leaer often asks me how we can improve the company and what we can do to change it or make it better.  I am confident that my leader will always be willing to listen and take my thoughts and feelings in to consideration.  They give bonuses to show gratificaton of a job well done.
387,"I have a good working relationship with my supervisor.  He provides the coaching and development that I need, but does not overstep his bounds and micro manage my every move.  He behaves in a respectful manner, always asking nicely if I will do certain taks for him.  I think that my relationship with my leader is similar to my coworkers relationship with him, at least my coworkers that are on the same management level as me.  Overall, I like working for this supervisor more than I have anyone else, becaus he is willing to let me manage the program as I see fit."
388,Our leader is Idiot as per I know. He only requires people to work in time and complete the work as per schedule whatever the circumstances will occur. He is not pleasant at all. I felt unhappy whenever I see him around me at work. His attitude towards usis very disgusting. I am living the company on next month and i will definitely ask the leader about the growth of mine.
389,"My leader allows me to speak my piece when I see an issue or have a suggestion on how to make things run better.  She also gives me direction when I have trouble coming up with one on my own.  She is also open to what I need to do to progress further in m career and allows me the time to work on those goals.  Others find her difficult to work with as she is very blunt and can be unforgiving in her attitude, however I am able to maintain my peace.  When others are having difficulty talking with her, they wll come to me instead for advise."
390,My leader provides a moderate amount of coaching and development. It is adequate. My leader generally shows me a decent amount of respect. My leader has an equal relationship with my coworkers.  My leader provides a moderate amount of coaching and developent. It is adequate. My leader generally shows me a decent amount of respect. My leader has an equal relationship with my coworkers.

391,I am not entirely satisfied with my working relationship with my leader. I feel he does not provide enough coaching and development. He does not always show enough respect to me or my co-workers. He just treats us like slaves or robots sometimes. I am notentirely satisfied with my working relationship with my leader. I feel he does not provide enough coaching and development.

I feel he does not provide enough coaching and development. He does not always show enough respect to me or my co-workers. He just treats us like slaves or robots sometimes.
392,My team leader is very good and very helpful he is solve my problem so he is very good he is very good on his work he know every thing his full confidence about his work.my leader is understand my problem and my situation he is very good on his work he gie me good tips about my work he is very good mind i am very happy work with my leader he is very helpful and he is follow his rule and he is very confortble with his work. i am very happy to work with my leader  he know everything
393,I really enjoy my working relationship with my direct supervisor. We have daily meetings every morning with our goals for the day and input on how to meet those goals so I believe she gives a decent amount of coaching. I know that I am respected because m supervisor treats me and an equal and always is open to my ideas and criticisms of how our team is running. I believe we all have very similar relationships with her. No one appears to receive any type of favoritism in our team. I feel that I am equal toboth my co-workers and supervisor.
394,"She doesn't provide a lot of guidance, but I don't exactly need to develop much further. She does let me know about opportunities for growth when they are available. She shows respect for me by not micromanaging, but by always offering to help when needed She gives me a lot of flexibility in terms of working from home or leaving early, as I have proven that I am reliable and will always finish my work. Most of my coworkers have a similar relationship with our manager, though the less reliable people are gven less flexibility and their work is much more closely monitored, where I am generally left alone until assistance is clearly needed."
395,I think I have a good working relationship with my leader.  She offers a lot of online training and one on one if needed.  My leader shows she respects me by asking my opinion on some decisions that have to be made at the site level.  My relationship withcoworkers is better than my relationship with my leader.  I can speak more freely with my coworkers and they are more receptive to my ideas.   I do feel like I can call my leader whenever I have a problem or question and she will help to resolve it.
396,My leader is more than willing to show you something if you don't know what you are doing. She makes it very comfortable to be able to go to her if you need help with anything. She shows every employee the same respect. She never shows favoritism. With ths being said is  so easy and comfortable to go to her when you need help.
397,My manager is a very tell vs ask kind of person. I find that he delegates good responsibilities to people including myself that aren't supposed to take on such tasks. He doesn't develop he just tells you what you've done wrong without guidance. I was surpised at that coming here. I thought this would be better in this company but I guess not. This surpassed me.
398,"My leader really teaches me a lot. I am given the utmost respect from my leader, as they consider me an equal. My leader treats everybody the same. We are all equals in the working environment, which is very important. Sometimes in other workplaces, peopl are alienated and treated badly, but here everyone a nice and has a common goal. We work as a team and do everything as a team. It is very nice working with my team leader. I am also looking forward to a promotion soon so all in all I am very happy with y job."
399,"Working relationship with my leader is cordial. My manager has great confidence in my capabilities and trying to bank upon the same to supplement & show cause his contribution in the organisation. For my efforts do I get returns in the form of increments nd promotions. But there is no significant coaching or developmental support from my manager. He respects my ability to demonstrate my capabilities, but can not expect personal respect or reciprocating professional response. My manager is actually an oppotunistic, he plays his card & tries to bank upon the weakness of his subordinates. Since it his character, his approach is more or less same towards all co-workers."
400,"My manager gives me very little coaching. The culture at my job is pretty much let everyone do their own thing. He shows his respect for me by always being fine with any needs I may have, for example, time-off needs, or ergonomic equipment needs. He also hanks me on days that I stay overtime to show that my extra efforts are valued. His relationships with my co-workers are pretty much in the same ballpark. They pretty much do their own thing and he allows it as long as they don't make major mistakes. He tanks them occasionally as well."
401,"My manager is so professional and have a great humanitarian personality. He is a real leader that leads me through a new ways not through do and don't. He is a great coach that I learn a lot from him. He is respects me and very understandable, he is alway putting himself in my shoes. He is great manager with everyone not only me and he is a fain manager. He is the manager that everyone like to be his manager. He never listen to anybody talking behind other's back which shows how much he is a respected manger, and even he let all solve their issues together under his supervision."
402,"He provides very little coaching and development, he expects us to understand what he wants without any direction. He also will constantly change his mind on the direction of a project. There have been many times he has asked us to change work even thoughwe completed the task as directed by him. There has even been a few time where were change projects multiple times, only for the project to turn into the original submission to him. He doesn't show he respects anyone. He treats us all similar, the only imortant thing at work is the bottom line. If we aren't meeting it, no mater who is at fault for it, it will be us who has the consequences."
403,"My leader is the one who teaches all new employees when we first start at the company. She goes out of her way to give us the training we all need, to ensure the job is done correctly.  She is never rude or mean, which is rare in this industry. I have nevr seen her get publicly angry with any of her employees, and she does go out of her way to make sure if there are issue that they stay within the organization and aren't gossiped about.  My coworkers would probably agree with me on this, they've all said he's a great boss and someone easy to work with."
404,"My leader at work offers any coaching and development that I think I might need.  This includes paying for me to go to any classes, or seminars.  My leader gives me advice on situations when she thinks that it could help make my job easier, or help me in  situation.

My leader shows respect to me by letting me do my work with little supervision.  My leader trusts me to get the job done correctly and on time without her having to checkup on me.  She also trusts my opinion when asked for.

I would say that y relationship is a little closer with my leader than some other employees.  I think that a lot of it is that I have proved myself and I have been working here for 14 years."
405,My leader is just concerned of his work n how is work should be done .he is not concerned how we work hard n how much contribution each ones of us give .he is just worried about his work n onces is work is done he is happy .he is not happy with the effortwe give n who has done more work n who has done less work he just need his work .he be in touch Just to complete his work n he is not concerned with our problem .he will respect you till his work his happening later he wl not react .the relationship betwen us is jusf work related .
406,My relationship with my leader for the most part is generally positive. We have weekly scheduled meetings to discuss progress on our division's projects and goals and have an open discussion about ideas we have about what we can be doing differently.  My eader shows respect by being respectful and genuinely listening and responding to everything I say when we have discussions. In the end my boss's whims will usually trump my own and that sometimes results in my ideas being shut down but I am not overly pu off by that as I feel that is his prerogative as the boss. He also treats all of my co-workers the same and equally.
407,"I have a very good relationship with my manager. However, it is a unique situation. We are the only two employees at this particular location. Our desks are about ten feet apart and we talk freely on a daily basis. Fortunately, we get along very well or i would it would be difficult to work together. Though he has more responsibility we both have the same level of expertise and training on most aspects of our jobs. If a situation arises where I am not sure what to do I know he would help me figure it out,if asked."
408,"My leader provides as much coaching towards my position and duties as possible. She doesn't belittle anything done by those in our department, and provides encouragement and support through the tasks and engagement with the rest of the organization. She sows respect by communicating and providing a great deal of understanding with any issue that presents itself, in work or personal life. She makes a point to take time to discuss any issue or accomplishment. My relationship with her seems to be slightly diferent than my coworkers' relationships with her -- I work more closely to her than they do. They perceive her to be more difficult to work with than I do."
409,"I think morale is very important, we need to be treated with respect to leadership and staff, adding a lot of knowledge, creativity and positive respect the opinions of others. Compliance with the provisions of the company to work on time. There is creatiity, promoting the independence of each individual. Do not use power to intimidate others, not to speak ill of colleagues, and take action when encountering problems. Building credibility and accountability to the people. Actively study and learn the progess of science and technology. Help colleagues in trouble at work. Build unity among colleagues and called on people to join"
410,"I have a good relationship with my manager. I often talk with him about my job. With the help of him, I can solve many work related problems. He respect all coworkers equally. He often provide some training and interpersonal skills. When we are not able t do some work he help us to solve it. My other coworkers also give him more respect. Our team have good coordination and best leader. We always complete our work on given time. So I have a good team leader with supportive nature. My coworkers have very god and positive opinion about my manager."
411,"I've been at the company longer than my leader and know the job better, therefore I guide him, not the other way around. He follows my lead and defers to my judgment in most instances of day-to-day team management. He handles complaints and disciplinary ations, while I essentially run the rest of the business. We're a small office so we all pitch in to help each other out. Our unit is tight-knit, we socialise during and after work, and we run very effectively because we know each others' strengths and weanesses and work together to get the job done. Compared to our head office, it feels very us against them."
412,"My relationship with my leader isn't very strong. The leader is very distant and has many responsibilities that keep him busy. Likewise, he has a great many people working for him, so he is unlikely to know anyone personally who works at my level. The leaer is a great role model and provides an example for his workers to emulate, but he is not otherwise involved in our daily lives in any meaningful way. He is a figurehead more than a 'boss'. He does make decisions that affect us, which bothers me since hedoes not know us very well, but that's the nature of the structure of our organization."
413,"1) My leader gives me coaching on projects when I ask for ideas or clarification.He takes input from me about what i want to do in training and looks for ideas on how I can do it the following year. 
2) He is respectful if he has negative feedback and givs me positive feedback too. He passes on what our final customer has said. I have family demands that require me to need time off, sometimes with little notice. He has been accommodating and has not made that an issue.
3) It appears that my leader speaks o others in our group respectfully for the most part. There is one guy in our group that he gets frustrated with at times. He shows his frustration, but doesn't get to yelling."
414,My leader coaches me once a month to show me how I can improve. If I make any mistakes during the period between that he kindly helps me. I really feel like he is my equal even with the monthly evaluation which means a lot. I'd say it's like we're friends
415,My relationship with my leader is good.   My leader helps me whenever I have an issue with my work or need guidance.   They are willing to listen.   They do not take a bad tone with me and are willing to show me how to avoid and issue or handle an issue. I have a much better relationship with my leader because I respect my leader.
416,"Our relationship is great. He's my cousin so I've known him a long time. He helps me get training material from websites, which is helpful,. I think he respects me a lot.  He shows me that he respects me because I have a lot of leeway. We all get along wel."
417,I think that the working relationship with my manager is quite good. When I need help he is always willing to do what he can to help me. He is also flexible with me when I need time off from work or when I need to leave early or come in late. I would say hat we have a pretty good relationship.
418,My manager gave me a decent amount of training on how to landscape and put down sod. He respects me by always complimented on my good work. My relationship is better than my coworkers because I've been working with him for 10 years. I do owe a lot fo him or helping me in life.
419,My leader has always had a loose leash on us. He lets us do our job as we see fit unless and until something goes wrong. He will then step in and guide us if we want it or need it. It is a great way of showing he respects our expertise and doesn't micromaage.
420,"My relationship is wth the general manager. Both she and I are new to our positions, so we scratch each others backs so to speak. She is there to help when I need her, which is good, because, the store is busy and sometimes I am in need of the extra experenced help."
421,My leader provide me with a large amount of coaching. We have a lot of continuing education and on the job training. My leader always makes a point to pull you to the side and let you know when you are doing a good job. My relationship with my leader is aout the same as other employees relationship with him.
422,"My relationship with my manager is awesome. I currently due for a promotion so she has been working hand and hand with me to get me 100% up to speed. She absolutely is amazing at being very thorough on all the certain tasks and processes I need to know upn my evaluation date. She maintains a perfect balance between work/outside of work relationships. She also treats people with the most upmost respect although I slightly see her favoring me to be honest, looks at me like a brother. She always has the answr to any of my questions I tend to ask."
423,"My director is a good person but a terrible leader. He clearly favors some in my department but not others. He has told me that he does not know how to talk to me. I have a co worker that is able to ""work from home"" because she does not get the same amoun of vacation time as the rest of the department. We all have 10 + years with the company, she has two."
424,"When I first started working here, my leader was the one who helped train me and get me up to speed. I was able to learn quickly because I was able to ask question and they were answered in a way that was helpful and he was patient with me as I learned th steps. The leader shows respect by listening to my concerns and not brushing them off. We all have the same relationship with our leader."
425,My current supervisor does not provide any support to my position.  He does not know my job nor does he know what I do in a day.  My supervisor shows respect for me by just leaving me to my job.  He does not interfere with what I am doing and does not tel me how to do my job. Two of my co workers have a much better relationship with my supervisor than I do.  They suck up to him and try to be his best friend.  That is not something I do.
426,"1) My leader provides a little coaching, but most of my coaching comes from other coworkers because I work in rehab and my manager is not the same type of clinician as me.  I get most of my coaching from more experienced rehab professionals in the same fild as me.

2) My manager shows that she respects me by asking about my life and my family and how I'm doing at work as well as praising me for the quality of my work.

3) My relationship with my manager is better than that of my coworkers.  One time she ylled at a coworker of mine, and their relationship has been changed since then."
427,my manager is always willing to help or coach me as well as point out my mistakes and show me how to correct them.she is very respectful and always is nice my relationship with her compared to others is there is more of a mutual respect for each other andmaybe a slight fondness on my side i respect what she has accomplished in her life both professionally and personally i can say she works very hard for both and and the success she has achieved has my respect and admiration! it makes my want to work more ntently for her
428,"my leader doesn't do much coaching, he expects us to already know the parameteres, he shows respect but that is about all, it is not just me he treats this way, he treats all my coworkers the same way. He is professional and courteous but not very helpfulon jobs."
429,"My leader is really helpful in professional aspects. He sends me for training programs and shares with me materials so that I can improve myself. Moreover, as I always complete my works well within schedule he gives me enough respect. My relationship withmy leader is ideal in my words."
430,"My relationship with my leader is mutually professional and respectful. My leader has provided me with the adequate training for me to do my job. My leader shows that they respect me by providing me with updates, as well as consults me regarding our progrss within our workplace. My leader has more of a casual and humorous relationship with my coworkers."
431,"I HAVE AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP WITH MY LEADER. SHE HAS SHOWN SO MUCH PATIENCE AND HAS SHARED SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE WITH ME. I ADMIRE HER AND LOOK UP TO HER IN SO MANY AREAS OF LIFE, SHE REALL TOOK ME UNDER HER WING AND HAS SHAPED ME IN SO MANY DIFFERENT SKILS NECESSARY TO PERFORM MY JOB."
432,"I trust and respect my leader as he shows much care and affection towards me and behave friendly and supports me in tough ways, he provides many opportunities to improve my knowledge and his coaching is always best and produce capacity of thinking and givs me more project and guidance to do that and he behaves very politely if i did some mistakes and do not show anger towards me and changes me and apart from other co workers he supports me alot"
433,My leader does not provide much coaching at all since he is not aware of how to do my job. 
434,He give me a daily training about our company project                                                   
435,There are times when the manager is good with development of staff bit it is usually for their personal gain.
436,does or did the job i now do has set up the training for the company and has me do some of the training to get a better fell of what is required to be a leader in the field i work. treats everyone on the same playing field
437,"My leader gives us a great deal of coaching and development.  If we need further guidance or have to get further training, he is very good at getting it for us.  He shows us that he respects us by not talking down to or demeaning us.  We get praised and rcognized regularly.  

Everyone gets along with our leader pretty well.  Some of the older coworkers used to work with him before he was promoted and they all have a good relationship."
438,My boss is a very good boss. She keeps an open door policy. I can come in at any time to discuss anything. She is always willing to cross train me so that I can learn more than just my job so I have that knowledge and experience for the future too.
439,"My boss is an older lady, and I love to hear her stories about the past. When she shares those stories, I learn alot from her. She offers tips and suggestions, and I can use those in other areas of my life. She is wonderful to work for, and she pays me wel and always tells me how much she appreciates me and that makes me feel good. By her being so easy to work for, I really can't imagine doing anything else right now. She doesn't really have many friends or family around, so I feel lucky to have her in mylife. There are no other employees, just me."
440,He provides many training sessions. Usually once a week theses occur. He values my opion and seeks it out. He usually comes to me when he has a question about how something has gone in his absense. He leaves me in charge of certain tasks that he would norally do on his own.
441,"my relationship is a largely autonomous one where we discuss objectives and specific outcomes, with me responsible for achieving the desired metric improvements.  we have weekly coaching sessions that are two-way discussions of project goings on.  we get long better than the leader does with others, as I do not tolerate any underhanded or passive aggressive stuff, even from the leader."
442,My leader is a poor example of a leader.  He is insecure and does not know how to do the job.  The younger staff know how to do it better than he does.  He will blame other staff for his mistakes and refuses to take responsibility for his mistakes and thi is a detriment to moral.  He does not elicit any respect from any staff in the office.
443,The relationship is excellent. He provided me a mammoth training with all features He always call me SIR even though I am younger to him. Everything is good with fantastic features.  The overall relationship between us is cordial and it more over healthy ithout any hiccups. We love each other.
444,"i have somewhat better then a neutral relationship with my leader or supervisor. My supervisor coaches us when we need it. Our leader does show respect to us at all times, and if we do something wrong, he will talk to us politely of what we did wrong. My elationship with my leader does not really have a major effect with my co-workers. I show professionalism to my supervisor and co-workers in everything that I do. We respect each other on the job."
445,my manager provides me the way of handling production pressure by making it happen by presenting the report and ending up with no problem with our side and proving that there is some other reason for the loss . 
446,My leader provides me with excellent development tools. I have access to the tools and he personally teaches me the system since I am am taking his old spot. He show me that he respect me when I come to work and I am treated like a professional like the oher people. No biased behavior towards my gender or the fact that I am a manager and am the youngest person there. My relationship with my leader is different that my co workers because I talk to my co workers like they are my kids and my leader like he i my big bro.
447,"     The leader, or manager, at my job knows less than we do. He was hired out of college and seems scared to death to make a decision. Because he knows so little, he tries to be picky about stupid aspects of the job, like cleanliness, which just makes hi seem petty and useless. He constantly hounds us about safety but constantly forgets his hard hat."
448,"My leader is a supportive person that really wants me to accomplish many things, his coaching is very helpful when I need to solve some problems however sometimes I don't receive so much support. He respect me and shows it when he try to listen and when h try to help me solve my problems."
449,"No coaching or development is provided by my leader.  My leader does not show much respect, but is responsive if approached about problems or ideas.  My co-workers have pretty much the same relationship as I do with my leader, except for a few who try to stablish a closer relationship and seek special favors (which normally aren't given)."
450,My boss provides resources to further my job requirements. They also provide classes to help invest in my future with the company. She shows respect by truly listening to my needs. If there is any type of situation where we need reinforcements she is alwas there to show a united front.
451,My leader is the owner of a small company and over the years we have a pretty good understanding of my role.  I am allowed to make suggestions and choose how I handle my workload.  I am also consulted on procedure and research and development when those pojects come up.
452,I would have to say my immediate supervisor is highly dysfunctional and ineffective.Though he has been in this industry for many years he has yet to learn the necessary skills and demonstrates carelessness when attempting to complete tasks.His attitude ismostly condescending and language is vulgar and hostile.Though most of us work together as a cohesive this can not be said for the supervisor.He believes his only purpose is to motivate workers to perform faster using intimidation and threatening tactics.
453,"It is largely a hands off relationship. working as a licensed professional, I am largely left to my discretion in most matters. I think most of my office has the same sort of relationship as I have. My leader does not necessarily show respect or disrespec, can be hard to read."
454,"I would describe my working relationship with my leader as one of the best work relationships I have had. My leader provides all of the coaching needed to ensure I am able to perform my job properly. My leader is very honest and straightforward, he is alwys the first person to commend me as well as everyone on our team when we do a good job. He respects my input on ideas to grow our business and be a successful corporation."
455,I have a very good leader.  He is always there to support me and give me advice about my job. He provides a great deal of coaching when it is needed and gives me space and flexibility when I do not need help.  I feel like he has respect for everyone.
456,I am new to the firm. My manager doesn't mingle with me much. He mostly talks to me for his personal helps and assistance rather than for the firm. He works for himself rather than the firm. Hence I didn't get any help or advice from my manager. He just oders my senior co-workers to help me. He doesn't have much respect among my co-workers for this reason.
457,"My supervisor doesn't give much coaching. A lot of times I feel like he is condescending. If we do a good job, we usually don't hear it from him until the meetings. If we do something wrong, we usually feel terrible about it. I know a couple of my co-workrs feel the same way, that he isn't very approachable."
458,"My working relationship with my manager could be better. It's not entirely her fault, but she has to relay almost daily policy changes based on ever-changing technological bugs and other issues (I work customer service for a popular app, and communicationbetween my team and the dev team is dismal). I wish she would go to bat for us more often in terms of improving communication. She also insists on a lot of hand-holding, wanting to approve decisions that should be entrusted to us. This creates a lot of exra work for the team (like if I want to make an exception for a good customer and grant a refund one day after the official refund period is over, instead of just doing so, I have to message my manager and wait for her to okay it). My manager acts like sh's part of the team, and I do feel like she respects us. However, I feel like I don't get as many of the kinds of shifts I'd prefer, even after specifically bringing this issue up with her. If I'm lucky to be assigned one of my preferred shifts a week andothers are getting 3-4, that's unfair."
459,He is good at making speeches and telling us our goals but he is hardly ever there because of meetings and things. He is also not available a lot. We have to rely on crew leaders mostly for support. Everyone in the department basically has the same experince with him. He does listen to you and try's to answer your questions..
460,he is a good person who emphasizes on personal attention and tries his best to guide the people under him and he values our suggestions and opinions and implements them when he deems it fit.he is cordial with everyone and has almost the same type of relaton with every person and he strives to bring the best out of everyone.
461,"My manager is very trusting of me and respects my opinion. I can tell that he values my judgement and wants me to succeed. In order to establish this relationship, I show an eagerness to help him out with tasks and offer my expertise where I can. I treat im differently than my co-workers, most of which are my employees. I will defer to his judgement when we have differing opinions."
462,My leader will offer coaching and development on an as-needed basis when an issue arises.  He assumes that each employee under him knows what they're doing and the company protocols until someone comes to him with a question.  He is much closer to my cowokers than he is with me because there is a core of employees who have been here for several years.
463,"Good Leader brings Good Relationship, my leader is always guide me in a proper way to achieve my goals, and he motivated me to do the work in a proper way, also he educated me to know the clear knowledge about my work, he shared his experience as well to nderstand the work in a good maner"
464,Actually my leader gives coaching such that to some extent I dont perform much than him.he is an extrovert and speaks differently at different times.he is a leader to be considered.he behavces good with all except to his team members.he is afraid as if wewill overtake him by doing some things
465,"He takes time to clarify any doubts i put up.
my relation with him is as same as with everyone, he never show any special insterest even though i dedicate myself to him.  He generally guide me in my work and see that i work accordingly for achieving goals he just want to benefit for himself."
466,"My leader give hints about nature of work and seeks what is required to develop that particular skill for the assigned project, he will provide necessary sources when asked, i had very good understanding with my leadership because we interact more and hasa positive approach towards me because hardworking mentality and intellectual skills to do project effectively in recent & old project."
467,I have a good relationship with my leader.  We communicate daily and are open and honest with one another.  We share ideas and he is able to give me constructive criticism and then move on.  We are able to take things lightly and laugh but also get the jo done.  He is there when I need help or have a question.
468,he doesn't provide anyno coaching and development 
469,When work with any leader i always keep in mind about the goals of company.I always observe whether my leader taking necessary steps to reach to goals.Some times I try to  convey my opinion about out comes.So he gives due weightage  for my suggestions..I aintain good relations with my leader even there are slight differences.
470,"When I get feedback it is very positive, however it is rare. He answers questions promptly and professionally, but sometimes I feel like I'm talking to a robot. I don't know how other co-workers' relationships are with manager because we all work remotelyand never see each other. As a top producing employee I would appreciate more communication and possibly advancement opportunities."
471,"He is very willing to listen to everyone. I think he's a great leader and truly cares not just for me, but everyone around him. I can talk to him anytime I need and he always stop and take the time to listen to me, ask for my opinion and really let me be ree to do what I need to do to succeed. He is very kind to everyone, not just me and that really makes for a great environment overall."
472,Work relation with my leader is good. We don't have any personal ego. We understand the company and my team goal and working towards to the goal. My leader respects all the individual. My leader maintain the same relationship with all individual in my Tea. He gives a individual space to work with freedom.
473,The relationship with my manager is pretty good I always help him and in return he helps me which is a blessing as not everyone has that relationship with there manager. We never argue or have altercations and treat each other with much respect. I feel weare closer than many other managers and employees.
474,"My manager and I have a good working relationship. He keeps me informed of things I need to know from the upper levels of the company and I use that information to support him. He works well with everyone in our department, but has a special relationship ith me and my two co-managers."
475,"My manager is always making sure we have opportunities for self development, though it is easier, since we are working at a college. He does care though, and pays attention. He shows me respect by allowing me to get my work done, with a minimum of oversigt or management from him; he is trusting me and my skills. I think that my coworkers have a similar relationship with him, since I see the same general things happening with and between them."
476,"When it comes to them, they are always willing to teach at any given moment. If you want to learn to do something all you have to do is ask and they will guide you down the right path. They show respect and expect it back like any human out there. The reltionship is on the same plane as anyone who is a hard worker."
477,My manager does not provide coaching and development. It does not occur to him. He is always very busy and over-committed and doesn;t have time for anything else. He does not think in those terms. He thinks about meeting deadlines. He is constantly preoccpied with other things going on. My relationship with him is similar to other co-workers.
478,"My manager is very friendly and cooperative one, He knows who to get work from its workers. He takes welbeings of each and every worker all most every day. Discussing every point in details from the workers and instructions every body which is better for he company. He is very helpful in general and is a good manager."
479,"My leader provides some coaching and leadership, as it is a company wide directive.  He is respectful and a decent person, and is good to work with.  I get along well with him, but is about equal to everyone else.  He treats everyone fairly and expects th same in return."
480,"She is the best leader I've ever had. She's considerate, understanding, respectful kind and smart. Whenever anything is needed she addresses me personally. I respect her and think she is a pretty amazing woman and leader. She thinks of the small things an the large ones. She's always looking out for our welfare."
481,The leader that I have is willing to do what it takes to help you become the best you can be. If it is coaching then they will be there and help you along the way. If its lending am ear they will do the same. They practice my door is always open routine i order to help us out.
482,"My working relationship is very one sided. My leader does not mentor or assist me in any way. He does appreciate what I do since I, more often than not, do his job for him. He does not give me credit however to his superiors. I have had multiple reports fom others that he repeatedly takes credit for anything I do. He spends his time reading his forums and blogs instead of doing his job. My coworkers hate him even more than I do."
483,"1) My leader provides limited coaching and development. When this is needed, we are usually sent to different conferences. 2) My leader will praise my accomplishments when I achieve them and take my ideas into account. 3) My relationship with my superviso is similar to that of my other colleagues, though sometimes the people that have been with the organization longer seem to get special treatment."
484,"I would describe my working relationship with my leader as very effective. We have a weekly meeting where we go over my goals, my work, what's going on in general, and any questions I have. I've requested to implement several new processes and softwares, nd everything has been approved. My leader seeks my input when making decisions that will impact me, even if only tangentially."
485,"I see my leader very little. He is often too busy, and I have gone entire weeks without interacting with him. I am left to figure things out on my own. I receive very little coaching and development from my leader. My leader checks-in from time-to-time. M co-workers have a very similar relationship with my leader."
486,"1- My leader provides good coaching and development. He tells me when I need to improve something I am doing, and he also allows me to have professional development. 2- He shows his respect by complimenting the work I do and coming to me for particular taks 3- I think that our leader treats everyone the same. He tries to give us any benefit he can."
487,the leader who co working with me is very lovable .he is very helpful .he helping me lot of to improving my coding knowledge.he always showing respect towards me.leader and coworkers all are very helpful to me.very kind persons all of them are.when i havea doubt i can openly talk them to solve my coding problem.
488,She is professional and caring. She goes out of her way to coach me to tell me what I am doing right or wrong. She respects me by caring about my well being. She is pretty even with all of us. She is different with us based upon our personality.
489,"My leader does hold a coaching session with each of his employees every other week, he also holds team meetings every week.

My leader does show repspect but he is very stand offish and doesnt really interact with anyone unless he needs to be.

My relatioship i thinkcis no different thank any of my co workers, like i said my leader doesnt really have any kind of relationship but a working one."
490,Actually my leader won't give any language related coaching.. they will.motivate ourselves to learn things. 
491,"My leader is really invested in seeing her team succeed, so she spends a lot of time giving feedback and coaching her team during the workday. Feedback, praise, and coaching are immediate, so there is always a clear idea of where we stand as employees andwhether or not the company is pleased with the direction we are headed in. My leader makes sure to speak to us kindly and never in a humiliating way, even coaching or disciplinary actions are done with a positive spin in private so that the employee is no losing face in front of their coworkers. My leader is really effective in treating all of my coworkers and myself in the same way, never letting on which employees she meshes better with on a personal level."
492,"I am the main cook/manager at a college. My main boss leaves me to run the kitchen how I want to as long as I get everything done, and I always do. I hardly interact with him at all. Everything is on a schedule and that is how things are run. He just come in every once and a while and looks around and tells me I am doing a good job. Thats it."
493,She allows me to take any training that I might need.  She listens to me when I have a concern and allows me to brainstorm ideas.  All of my coworkers also get along and have respect for my leader.  She is kind and fair to myself and all of my coworkers.
494,"We have a reasonable working relationship, he does his best to communicate with me though when he is behind in his work or stressed he sometimes is lacking. He shows his respect by not micromanaging me. In comparison to the other employees our relationshi is probably better as far as trust because he knows he can count on me to keep up with all the policies and to enforce them."
495,My leader is not i[ to the level and he always used to find faults on our work despite he 
496,My relationship with my leader is a good one. He always is giving good input on how to improve work performance on the job. He is very polite and understanding of all the employees. He is very easy to get along with and does not hesitate to give complimens to someone who has performed well on the job.
497,"My manager sees his job as helping his direct reports to get what they need to do their job, and I like this approach. He is constantly asking if we need anything from him, and is honest and transparent with us about the work we're doing and why we're doig it. I think my teammates feel the same way."
498,My manager will give me moderate level coaching. He sometimes provide coaching for my development.
499,My boss respects us all by treating us with respect and being grateful for whatever we do for her. She never would tell us to do something she always asks politely and makes sure we have all the information we need to do the project.  In other words she teats us all like an equal and that we are part of her team.  She is wonderful to work for.
500,My leader at the beginning gave me a lot of coaching. She always was there to show me the ropes when I was confused. She taught me a quicker and more efficient way to get the work done that way I would not get overwhelmed. As far as respect goes she alway allows me to be a free thinker. She allows me to take things into my own hands and if I mess up she would never throw it in my face. She does this with all of my coworkers and not just I.
501,I have an ok working relationship.  She doesn't provide any coaching or development whatsoever.  She does respect me though.  She provides much more coaching and development to other coworkers. She expects me to work independently and create assignments o my own without assigning me anything.
502,my supervisor does not provide much coaching. he generally expects you to do as asked and gives assignments each day. people within the team are usually more helpful with training than my manager. my co-workers have the same relationship. we do not find te supervisor to be very knowledgeable.
503,My manager tells me ways that I can improve so that my boss is pleased.  She shows me respect by telling me how she appreciates my hard work.  My relationship compares to other coworkers relationships with her as in she always has an open door for us.
504,My leader provides no coaching and development. She has told me that I am on my own. My leader respects me be not micromanaging each job and trusting me to get it done on time. She disrespects me by overloading me with work and occasionally yelling at me.My co-workers and I seem to share the same relationship with my supervisor. Neither is more or less favored.
505,My leader knows that I am a self motivator. He know's I don't need much guidance or support unless I request it. My leader never second guess's me asks me my advice on issues and lets me make the call. I get along best with my boss.
506,"The relationship with my leader would be best describe as fractured. I work hard and put forth more effort than several other coworkers to include those above me in the pay scale. I only see my leader if I approach him about something or he needs somethin from me. He does show respect in the way that when I address a topic with him he takes my word with high regard, and does come to me for information as needed. He is very aloof with not only me but all my coworkers. we have had to report this lack of iniiative with us to higher management."
507,"He gives timely and objective feedback when it's needed. When something is done very well he recognises the efforts.He is good delegating work appropriately, taking into account the abilities of each employee.He consults on matters that affect staff and h mostly thinks of our well being. He gives reasons why certain actions should be taken."
508,My relationship with my leader is a good one. I believe that everyone should be able to do the things that they are supposed to do that makes them up to be an official part of the team. My Twitter is very good at delegating orders and finding solutions tosituational problems. I think this is what exemplifies him as a perfect candidate for the role.
509,"My boss is also my cousin, so we have a very close relation even outside of work. At work, it's quite great - He always recognizes the effort someone puts in and rewards it, him and his co-manager wife have personally trained me to do various tasks, even ther tasks that others may not do. I feel like I am the closest thing to a manager this place has, though I may be over-estimating my position. 

My boss always thanks me for my work, and always treats me right."
510,My company and my boss are very old school. They give assignments and expect results. Feedback is generally given once a year with a very minimal raise. Occasionally they will compliment work however great work is expected as the norm.Questions are ok as ong as you show that you understand.
511,A lot of coaching and development is provided to me and others as well. In fact too much and constant repetition. My leader is very kind and respectful to me and all my coworkers. She treats us all equally and nicely. I would not say that she favors one eployee over another or that any relationship with her is different.
512,My manger lets me determine the level of coaching and mentoring I need. She rarely approachs me with it but is available when I request it of makes time. She never re schedules. She gives me my privacy and lets me determine how to my job . She does not Pr and approaches respectfully of there is any issue. I think she has developed more friendly social relationships with others that have been here longer.
513,"My 'leader' provides me with nothing. He just uses his leadership position to say 'I'm a leader' but he actually leads nothing. No motivation, no respect, no recognition. Most of the times I feel like he's jealous of me. May be it has to do with the fact hat he's much older than me. The same goes with my other colleagues. He doesn't like to give credit to nobody!"
514,"My manager basically adopts a ""hands off"" policy with me unless he has a question about something.  He has asked for some favors in the past, and I have had to ask for some special exceptions too.  It is a good balance.  I feel like we have a good workingrelationship.  I can't speak for others, but I don't feel like a favorite, but I also don't feel like I'm being watched.  I appreciate having the autonomy to make decisions in my own department."
515,"He provides answers to my questions, and listens to my issues on the job. I can get constructive criticism without problems from him. Our relationship is somewhat closer than that he has with other co-workers. I feel that he respects me, my opinions, my neds, and my manner in which I work."
516,"my leader is my first teacher in my career .he understands that when i want his help .he is very encouragable . if i made a mistake in my work ,he help me to correct that mistake or i did a job in in time with full responsibility he appreciate me . he is like a brother who helps in difficult situation"
517,"My supervisor is not real involved with their employees. If you approach her she will listen to you but otherwise communication can be difficult. She is really busy though and has alot of responsibility to handle so I try to figure things out on my own fist before I come to her with a problem. She handles everyone the same way, in which she is very quick to dismiss you and not wanting to be bothered unless its really something important."
518,"My relationship is not very good with my leader. (1) He provides little opportunity for development as he never provides constructive feedback. He, also, will promise new career opportunities that he never follows through on. (2) He often omits details tht make him uncomfortable to discuss which does not show respect for me. When he doesn't provide information to me, I end up looking bad. (3) My coworkers share a similar relationship with my leader."
519,"My boss has an Emotional Quotient (EQ) of a 10 year old.  She has no idea how she comes off when speaking to people.  She tends to speak harshly, and when she is pleasant it is easy to tell she is not sincere.  99% of the people in my organization feel th same way."
520,"My boss is extremely invested in me having all the necessary skills and knowing exactly what I do, so he spends a lot of time one-on-one with me and also as part of a group making sure we understand all aspects of our job and also have all our questions aswered by him. He is very polite and treats all employees as his equals, always takes note of our feedback. He has about the same relationship with everyone he manages."
521,"My manager is rarely available in the office for coaching or help. This is very annoying in my career as I am based on comission and he is never available to help or provide guidance from meetings. All I have done is work solo since I graduated. He respecs me and thinks I am great and praises me constantly, but it oesn't help me earn more."
522,"My leader provides a lot of coaching to help me become a better worker for the customers that come in our store. My leader becomes calm and makes some jokes and always gives me tasks to do and he has told me he looks up to me. I believe I am special in myleaders eyes but, he still gives everyone else the same respect."
523,My leader provides me lots of material or reference to improve my knowledge for my as well as organisation's growth. He also refer me to various learning as well as motivational program.He shows his respect by giving me space and time to show my creativit during any project.Our relationship is better than my co-workers because we share our personal things to each other.I like my manager.He is very talented and good person too.
524,"My boss is very quiet and passive aggressive. I haven't received a review in about 5-6 years, so I have no idea how I'm doing. I'm assuming I'm doing fine since I still have a job! He provides no direction at all. I see him every day and he sits right nex to me, but I could go an entire week without having uttered a single word to him."
525,Our manager is a pretty terrible boss. They don't really know how to communicate very well with most of the employees. They don't understand how most of their employees are surviving pay check to pay check because they are so out of touch with reality on ow much most of us make.
526,My Relationship with my leader is not quite good as he don't let me present any of my innovative or creative work to the senior leadership. He is a micro manager and don't give us freedom to work which will foster any innovation. We don't get any coachingor mentoring from him as he only cares about deliverables. My leader doesn't respect me as I don't agree with his plan most of the time and we have conflicts over it. The relationship with my co-workers is almost same except for junior members who doesn'twant to have any argument with manager for better future.
527,"We work well together.  We learn from each other.  We share cases and kick around how to treat patients.  When there is a dilemma, we work it out together.  He helps and guides me with suggestions and questions.  His experience is a valuable resource for e."
528,"I usually take guidance of my leader. I discuss every problem with my manager,also suggest  a solution, mostly he takes my suggestion,  rarely rejects. I also discuss innovative ideas which I would like to implant, my manager gives a feedback which helps e to improve in my future works."
529,My Leader provides me a friendly relationship to achieve organizational goals. He explains me clearly the work which have to be done by me and my team members. He will be friendly with me and make me realize my mistake. He will give respect to our feeling and used to implement our ideas too. He will give good advice to reach our goals.
530,"While I did not receive much coaching, my supervisor treats me with the same respect that he gives other long term employees and it makes me feel that I am part of the team and important part of the company.  I feel like all of my co workers also receive qual treatment."
531,"My manager is somewhat freindly with his team members.Whenever , a new technology arises , he makes sure everyone should learn it. he arrange for a weekend classes with a specialized master in that technology. and ask opinion. and he provide appraisal basd on individual team members performance .my rapport with my manager is good."
532,I work closely with the Pastor of my church. He is my spiritual leader. He is loving and caring and show love to everyone in our church. He is easy to work with and offers correction when needed and direction. I is a pleasure to work with him and am glad hat he is my leader.
533,"Our leader mentors us based on his experience to help coach and guide our development. He will provide comments or advice on areas of improvement. He will reward us with monetary gift cards to approve our good work, which makes all our hard work feel apprciated. I appreciate our leader does not act high and mighty but has the same relationship as all the co-workers. We can have a natural relationship with one another and talk about stuff outside of work."
534,"I would describe my relationship with my leader as one that really isn't a relationship. We talk when we need to, and other than that I really don't hear from them. I don't feel there is much respect because even though I am hear everyday on time, with a mile on my face, and prepared to get some work done I still don't feel like I can go to my leader if I need some type of assistance. Instead, I feel as if I am just kind of on my own, and left to figure things out on my own. I think this is the same relatonship that most of my coworkers have with this leader. The work environment is such that we only speak to our leader over the phone, and rarely in person. And it seems that this leader prefers things this way."
535,They respect me and obey my words.but they wont give salary.we have to struggle for that.basically they are good.but for giving salary they seems to be bad.They never understand problems.always they repeat the same words.they assume to we have to understad their problems.they are stupids
536,My manager treats me as an equal allowing me to exchange of ideas as well as provide feedback on ongoing projects or even her own work.  As a result our team is better coordinated and better prepared than other teams allowing us to perform better than anyother team in our business.
537,"1. Maybe it would be nice to have more courses or training in my workplace. Last time I had a training was in October. However, we are constantly learning new things by the way the work runs. 2. My leader is alway respectful and kind. I cannot complain. 3 I don't have any co-workers, besides my leader."
538,Me and my leader are working like two real brothers. His nature is so cool. His behavior is great and he motivated person and flow motivated waves to all team members. He respect all team members. I am always respect my leader rather than my co-workers. Iconsider him as Boss and Boss is always right.
539,"My job needs a consistent training and development and my boss loves teaching me and always respects me. She always cares about my well-being. My boss is generally a really nice person so she shares the same good relationships with my other co-workers as ell. She always offers me food, ask how I am doing consistently."
540,"I am a senior research fellow, I am supposed to work with my guide (manager) very closely. I have to keep updated him almost every week and our meeting are more of a discussion. 
New ideas and proactive involvement from the researchers are always welcome y our guide. This kind of involvement are reciprocated by guide in forms of prompt approval of other proposals like contingency supports, travel grants etc. 
There are not much difference between other's relationships with our guide, the interactions are f the same kind, and the reactions from seniors are of similar kind."
541,"My manager knows her business and I do respect her. There are two issues that challenge our relationship. First, she has told us outright, do not bring me problems about service or products because there is nothing I can do about it and I'm not making wavs by sending such issues ""upstream"". Secondly, she has her favorites and doesn't attempt to hide it."
542,My leader provides coaching and development through a number of outlets such as meeting and Professional development workshops that are provided regularly throughout the year to keep us well updated and informed of different changes. My leader gives me th same respect I give him or her by having an open and honest dialogue with trust between us. I believe the relationship I have with my leader also reflects those of my fellow co-workers mutual respect.
543," My leader does not provide that much coaching. He does try to show me how each project is going and what he intends or needs to do for each one. But I think he does it in order for me to provide any thoughts that he may be overlooking and not necessarilyto teach me. I don't talk that much about my personal life, while talks about it non stop. My relationship with my leader is pretty much the same as all his employees, since he talks to everybody the same way."
544,"I would like to preface this survey that when you talk about ""leaders"" I am thinking of our CEO and Upper Management.  When you say management or supervisor, I am thinking of my direct boss. 

I am in kind of a unique situation where my leader is my fathe in law.  So he provides me a lot of coaching and development, but he does that for everyone so I fell like I am not an exception to the rule or anything. He shows that he respects all of us by allowing us to be involved in an ""all hands meeting"" each monh and keeps us informed on company changes. My relationship is a little more personal since he is my father in law but still kept business professional while at work."
545,My working relationship with me leader is very rewarding. All employees in our organization are offered a series of coaching and development that goes on throughout the year. There are many opportunities for additional one on one training and open lines of communication. My leader involves me in decisions regarding our department and individual work duties. I feel that my relationship is the same in comparison to my manager's relationship with the other employees.
546,He always talks with me with respect.  He also discusses the work in detail in a very friendly manner. He always shares his experiences with us and help us execute our work efficiently.  He always involves me in discussion of work related to me and asks fr my views.
547,"My leader provides me with no coaching a development, I have been given my job and I am expected to perform my tasks. My leader does not behave like they respect me, this is the same as the rest of my co-workers. Our leader is our leader and they expect u to follow with no respect given to us."
548,I have a good working relationship with her. We understand each other and the job at hand.We both just do our jobs and help each other out when needed. I believe some other coworkers have a closer relationship with her than I do though not necessarily beter and that is mainly just because they work with her more while I am more independent.
549,I  have a very poor relationship with my manager.   She doesn't show interest in anything but how to look good to her boss. She will take my ideas and present them as hers. She is very degrading at times. She shows favoritism to others who choose to constntly talk about how great she is.
550,"We have a construction company. Which employs about 50 people. My boss is very kind man, and I've known him for many years. He hired me to work for him. It is harmful and very shy person, but thanks to him, I am currently working."
551,"My relationship with my boss is fairly desirable. I can always go to my boss with any concerns, questions, or requests. My boss always listens and does the best he can help, cooperate or compensate. My boss always behaves responsibly and even during stresful times will always understand and think rationally. I feel that my boss treats my co-workers the same as he treats me."
552,My leader does coach and reprimand me along with my fellow coworkers. My leader doesn't generally show that they care about us personally. He only really seems like he only cares about getting the appropriate results at work no matter what. He doesn't genrally show that he respects any of us.
553,"In general, my leader is well-informed about the vast majority of the tasks I go through throughout the day, and is always willing to step in and discuss issues I might be having, but in general there is little ""coaching and development"" that is really neessary by this point, as I've been here for over 10 years now. He shows his respect by hearing me out when I feel the need to share my opinion, and trusting my expertise when issues come up that I feel confident and authoritative on. In general, he treatseveryone with a similar degree of respect and doesn't play favorites, but those who have demonstrated a tendency toward slacking and messing up tend to be kept on shorter leashes."
554,there is barely any training given here. and then when you do something wrong they yell at you. they show no respect for anyone her or the fact that we keep saying things are messed up and they def show favoritism to certain employees
555,She offers suggestions for expanding my knowledge and points me in the direction of areas of growth.  She listens to what I have to say even if she may not agree.  She stands up for me and had my back when people think they were shorted..  I have no idea ow my relationship with her compares to my other teammates' relationship with her.  I do know she is well liked and respected by all of us.
556,He gives me timely input and takes a monthly assessment to know my training needs and career progress graph.My relation is very cordial and healthy one. We share a good rapport and respect each other. We have an understanding and are concern with each othrs consent and views on each task we work on
557,My leader provides with me a better knowledge about the current scenarios and about the market. Thus i could able to manage the whole schedule as per plan so that I could impress the whole team with the timely delivery of projects. He also find time to sove the problems if any with whole heartedly and patiently. It is very much easier and free to mingle with him for every circumstances.
558,"My department chair is new but she is articulate and visionary. She has does a great job of cultivating relationships with the other faculty members understanding their goals and aspirations. There's not a lot of coaching needed, she mainly coordinates an manages the various needs and wants of the other members. She shows respect by creating a path of success for everyone. I think she has a great relationship with all the faculty."
559,"My leader shows a clear and positive vision for our company. My leader is compassionate and cares about the well being of those who work for the company, and is extremely supportive of the work we do. We have a growing company, but when it is needed my leder rewards the workers with extra incentives when possible."
560,Relation with my leader is very positively. He such a very helping toward me.I am interact with my leader daily in working hour. He give a much greater response. He provide me a task that higher up my knowledge and skill.He behave very positively or respetfully to me. I consider that my relation with my leader is very accurate.
561,My manager is pretty much into only looking to get the things done but hardly cares about development of either me or anyone in the team. He don't care of anyone's deveopment plan in the team. He hardly spends time with team to understand team. He only cae only about how much me or anyone in the team deliver.
562,My leader does not do much in the way of coaching or mentoring.  She sometimes acts respectfully and other times very disrespectfully.  It's never the same which can be confusing.  She appears to like you one minute and then not he next day.  My coworkersall have the same relationship with my leader as I do.
563,very little coaching is provided to enhance my skills. there is no such thing in our organisation. Its only the managers who show some positive vibes to enhance the skills. The leader reciprocate similar to my efforts. and help me understand the situationand go beyond his limits to favor me. Its the similar relation among the leader and my colleagues.
564,He provides full support and gives training when required. He is very patient and caring. I can discuss any problem with him. I am sure to get the support I need.  I feel he is the best leader for me. I can improve a lot in my career with his help.
565,"My stepmother is my ""leader"" - she provides me coaching in the work that I do, even though she is frequently patronizing about it. Since we are the only employees, we do have an intense, sometimes good, sometimes emotional (not good or good) relationship rofessionally. It's very challenging and sometimes she does not respect me."
566,My leader is a very strong individual!  She makes sure that I understand exactly what is expected of me...and gives me coaching and input when I don't.  She provides constructive critizism in a way that is respectful and helpful.  I always want to do bettr after I speak with her.
567,"She tends to be rather absent save for some occasional moments of panic when she comes urging me to solve some urgent problem. She doesn't much show respect and often makes it clear that it's not my business to understand or know the reasons for whatever 'm developing  at the moment. On the other hand, her usual staying out of the way also means she doesn't usually object if i have to ask for changes in time schedule or  a similar favour. I don't see her behaving very differently toward my coworkers, so a least i guess she doesn't especially target me as unworthy of her attention."
568,"I think the best thing my leader does is not interfere. I technically have two leaders, which are the founders of the Pit Bull rescue where I work some days and volunteer the others (because it's not in the budget to pay me full time). I've been with thisrescue for 4 years. I was involved in dog rescue (volunteering and fostering) for 8 years prior. The founders of the rescue know my history. We may not always see eye-to-eye on certain things, but they give me my freedom when it comes to working with the ogs. They do still require certain routines, but other than that, they trust my judgement. They are not the same with the board members or other volunteers. The three of us are the only people that handle certain dogs. They also know if there is a rescue all or if I'm out helping look for a lost animal, transporting, or whatever that I am going to handle myself in a way that positively reflects the rescue. We have become very good friends through the years. Thank you is never needed. They know if they nee me they don't even have to ask. They treat me the same way. If I have an emergency tomorrow or just need help with something, I know they'll be there. We have gone through many periods where we didn't speak for more than a week because of a difference ofopinion, but it doesn't change our commitment to the animals, and therefore, we eventually move past it."
569,"Am given lots of freedom as long as I do the work expected of me. No coaching and  development other than emails regarding procedure changes. Everyone is treated the same. Respect isn't something lavished on a few, but it is given equally to all unless yo are a problem."
570,My working relationship with my leader is excellent. He is the best leader that I have ever got. I respect him as he is very sincere and honest in his work. He always helps his coworkers without any delay. He is a man of virtue and I truly admire him a lo.
571,"Working in the trades is a different animal than working an office type of job.  My supervisor doesn't care about coaching or showing respect, all they care about is on time and on/under budget, then move on to the next job.  My supervisor treats everyoneequally, they treat us all like dogs, and if we don't like it, don't let the door hit us on the way out. There is always someone cheaper to do the same job."
572,"I would describe my working relationship with my manager as a partnership. I'm flexible in what I can and will do for our company, and in exchange I have more freedom then I had at my previous job. We work well together, talking about what needs to be covred or completed throughout a business day and making sure we are on task to finish what we need to accomplish. They show they respect me by asking my opinions on meetings I cover or on how I want to cover a story."
573,"My leader does her best to guide me, but she is often sidetracked and does not pay attention. My relationship with her is about the same as everyone else has, she tries to pay attention to us all, but often falls short because she cannot keep up with everthing. She does her best to be kind and respectful to us, and make time for what we need."
574,"My leader is extremely hands-off regarding my day-to-day work, as well as my co-workers'. This is understandable to me because she's a hard worker herself, which I fully respect, and she leads another team aside from mine. She doesn't provide much coachin and development because she believes I'm self-sufficient enough not to need it."
575,"My manager is more of a peer than a supervisor. She and I collaborate together on many projects, and we get along as friends. She shows me she values my work and lets me know how much I have grown as an artist since starting with the company. She sometime has problems getting along with other people at work who may treat her less than fairly, and are especially harsh on her if she makes a mistake, but she is by far the most talented artist in our organization, so she is highly valued."
576,I don't have a great relationship with my manager. He is on site one day a week and is available by phone/text occasionally. He doesn't communicate with me on new projects or special projects. He likes to keep me out of tasks as much as possible. It is exremely difficult to show a lot of enthusiasm about my job when my manager doesn't play well with others.
577,"She meets with each of us one on one every two weeks and meets with all of us as a group every two weeks to discuss current and upcoming projects.  This provides us coaching.  I think because she has known the others longer, she has a stronger relationshi with her."
578,"1) In my day to day work I'm pretty seasoned, so my manager do not need to come and coach me for so many things.. He guides as an when needed. he gives his input during critical issues or critical timeline. 
2)We have pretty friendly relationship, he listn to me in the time of friction between other cross functional team, which shows his respect towards me.
3)I'm probably having better terms with my leader since we are at same age and similar experience. He is my boss since he is older than me in current rganization. My other peers are little young and fresher so I'm having better relationship compare to others."
579,"My supervisor and my relationship is somewhat tense. I honestly don't respect him because I don't think he knows what he is doing. I also don't think he wants to improve but rather would stay status quo which at this moment isn't good. I know he respects e because I do most of the work and is responsible for more items that I should be. My relationship with my leader and my co-worker's relationship is a bit similar but he seems to respect my other co-workers less. I don't know why this is so but when I ovrhead conversations they are having, I see my supervisor being more negative towards them which he really isn't to me. I base this on the fact that I am doing way more work and he knows this so he doesn't want to rock the boat."
580,"1. biweekly meetings to set goals, discuss how the department is doing, and if I have any suggestions or complaints. 2. 1 on 1 attention, quick responses, and follow through on requests. 3. I believe my coworkers and I have the same respect and quality reationship with our leader/manager. I have not noticed any favoritism."
581,"My leader provides me with most of the help and training I need to do my job. They show they respect me by listening to my opinions and sometimes changing things at work based on my input. We don't always get along on a friend level, but they are a comepeent boss."
582,"My leader seems to want to provide coaching and leadership to me, but doesn't ever make the time to do so. He is mostly friendly and respectful in our interactions so I do feel respected. Other co-workers seem to have a stronger relationship with him, likly because our leader is an extravert, and so are they, thus getting along better."
583,"I would describe my working relationship with my leader as distant. He does not coach me, train me, or compliment my good work. He does not treat me fairly, maybe because I am a newer employee. Most of my co workers are a lot older than me, and they've ben working at the company for decades."
584,Our working relationship is very professional and well reciprocated.It is also very respectable and we always make sure to keep of each others backs.This is especially when our roles do not measure up to our capabilities.My leader would also back me up an time and i on the other hand would stand up for him any day.
585,The relationship is one of equality and mutual respect. I do not feel negatively in our interactions. I feel that I am taken seriously. I feel that I am cut slack when slack is needed. I feel that I am often put upon though at times because I have demonstated clear ability and skill in the past and so harder more demanding tasks are given to me.
